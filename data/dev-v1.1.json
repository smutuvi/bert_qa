at federal labs since 2014. a usa today network investigation published last year [2015] found hundreds of additional accidents with dangerous pathogens at corporate, university, government and military labs nationwide -- and a system of self-policing and fragmented oversight that obscures failings by facilities and regulators.', 'the review is the latest to examine how a research facility at dugway could have mistakenly shipped live anthrax specimens -- labeled as killed -- for more than a decade to unsuspecting researchers developing detection equipment and diagnostic tests against bioweapons. the live anthrax ended up at nearly 200 private, academic and federal labs located in every state plus 9 foreign countries.', \"dugway's failures to fully kill anthrax specimens with radiation went undetected for more than a decade by military officials and federal lab inspectors from the centers for disease control and prevention. it was only discovered last may [2015], when a private biotech firm that received some of dugway's purportedly killed anthrax specimens did their own tests and found the spores could still grow.\", \"dugway's authority to work with any potential bioterror pathogens remains suspended by the cdc. and in an interview with usa today, lt. gen. thomas spoehr said dugway will no longer be allowed to produce pathogen specimens for shipment to other facilities.\", '\"they will make what they need for their own internal testing purposes,\" spoehr said, \"but they will not be an exporter of biological products for the greater world or anybody else other than for dugway\\'s internal use.\"', \"spoehr said all of the pentagon's biodefense labs remain under a self-imposed research moratorium while a new, unified lab oversight structure is put in place and protocols for working safely with pathogens are standardized and undergo scientific review. the process, especially creating verified kill methods for anthrax specimens -- plus reliable tests to verify the spores are dead -- could take another year, army officials said.\", 'restarting the biodefense research is critical in developing a wide range of tests and equipment to protect against deadly pathogens, such as those that cause ebola, plague, botulism and anthrax, said maj. gen. brian lein, commander of the u.s. army medical research and materiel command. \"we have to do this to protect our troops going into harm\\'s way,\" he said.', \"the new accountability review highlights this mistaken shipment of live anthrax, which the report said went to the lawrence livermore national laboratories, as one of several red flags that should have triggered wider safety reviews and action years ago by dugway's own leadership.\", \"background----------on 22 may 2015, a private company notified the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) that it found a low concentration of viable (live) _bacillus anthracis_ spores in a shipment from the u.s. army that should have only contained non-viable (dead) spores. the cdc notified the department of defense (dod) of this unauthorized shipment of viable _bacillus anthracis_ and determined that the material originated at dugway proving ground (dpg), utah. as a result, the cdc and the dod investigated dpg's history of _bacillus anthracis_ inactivation and determined that between 2004 and 2015, the life sciences division at dpg (dpg-lsd) prepared a total of 86 lots of inactivated _bacillus anthracis_, in support of the critical reagents program (crp) at fort detrick, maryland. the crp serves as a source for biological materials (such as inactivated _bacillus anthracis_) used to develop countermeasures required to protect u.s. military forces from biological threats. the crp maintains its antigen repository at dpg-lsd. the crp routinely directs the shipment of biological materials produced at the antigen repository at dpg-lsd to external government and commercial laboratories involved in countermeasure development. the crp antigen repository is the only dod laboratory engaged in large-scale production and shipping of select agents to external entities.\", 'at the time of production, dpg-lsd conducted viability testing that demonstrated that no live _bacillus anthracis_ remained, so a death certificate was issued for each of these 86 lots. following the 22 may 2015 discovery by the private company, dpg-lsd used a newly developed cdc protocol to re-test the viability of the lots of inactivated _bacillus anthracis_ remaining in its inventory (33 of the original 86). results showed that 17 of the 33 lots contained low concentrations of viable spores. it is still unclear whether or not this newly developed testing protocol would have identified the live _bacillus anthracis_ had dpg-lsd utilized it when originally conducting the viability test, or if some unknown scientific phenomenon allowed the spores to \"heal\" in the intervening time period. ultimately, cdc, with support from dod, determined that over a 12-year period samples from these 17 lots had been sent to 194 laboratories in all 50 states, the district of columbia, 3 territories and 9 foreign countries.', \"in response, dod instituted a variety of measures to safeguard public health, including directing a 30-day review of the dod's safety practices for generating and handling inactivated _bacillus anthracis_. the findings of this 30-day review were documented in a report on 13 jul 2015 (review committee report: inadvertent shipment of live bacillus anthracis spores by dod). on 23 jul 2015, dod issued a moratorium on the shipment of inactivated _bacillus anthracis_. the secretary of the army, in an abundance of caution, subsequently directed safety reviews at all army laboratories working with _bacillus anthracis_ and other deadly pathogens. he expanded the dod moratorium to include all biological select agents and toxins (not just _bacillus anthracis_). he also directed the formation of 2 teams to address this situation. one team, led by ltg thomas spoehr, was tasked to prepare a comprehensive implementation plan to address the findings and recommendations of the 13 jul 2015 dod report. the 2nd team, led by mg paul ostrowski, was tasked with conducting an investigation, under army regulation 15-6, into the facts and circumstances that contributed to the unintended and unacknowledged shipment of viable _bacillus anthracis_ spores from dpg-lsd.\", \"the 15-6 investigation team reviewed the reports prepared by the cdc and dod. the team developed an investigative plan and visited laboratories at the edgewood chemical and biological center (ecbc) and the u.s. army medical research institute of infectious diseases (usamriid) to obtain a basic understanding of the science, organizational structure, and functions at 2 of the primary facilities working with _bacillus anthracis_. from 17-21 aug 2015 the team traveled to dpg-lsd to gather evidence. during the evidence gathering process, the 15-6 investigation team conducted environmental sampling and found contamination outside of primary containment in one of the laboratories at dpg-lsd. the cdc was notified, and in response conducted a re-inspection of dpg-lsd on 27-28 aug 2015. on 28 aug 2015, cdc suspended the certificate of registration for dpg-lsd to possess, use, and transfer _bacillus anthracis_ and directed that all _bacillus anthracis_ in dpg-lsd's possession be securely stored to prevent theft, loss, or release. on 31 aug 2015, cdc suspended dpg-lsd's certificate of registration for all select agents. the remainder of this executive summary focuses on the findings and recommendations of the 15-6 investigation. all references to dpg and dpg-lsd leadership and management

is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. the bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. the disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity).', 'a different pathovar (strain) of the same species, _x. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice. it occurs in asia and west africa and yield losses of up to 30 percent have been recorded. symptoms vary from blb early on, but in the later stages of the disease look similar to blb. they may include translucent interveinal streaks extending to become orange lesions which may kill the leaf. yellowish bacterial exudates may be seen. bacteria may enter through small wounds on the leaf surface, including insect damage. plants are susceptible at all stages, but infection is most damaging at the tillering stage. bls is more prevalent in the rainy season. the pathogen survives between seasons on volunteer rice and leaf debris. it is seed borne and can also be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water (rain, irrigation) and mechanical means

fungus _magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously classified as a strain of _m. grisea_, synonym _pyricularia oryzae_). it is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. when nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. when infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. more than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.', 'symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. the disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. the fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. disease management may

meningococcal disease men who have sex with men (msm) and all individuals 25 years or older attending social venues associated with the gay community. this policy was extended beyond the paris region as a reaction to the continuing spread of serogroup c isolates belonging to a new lineage within clonal complex cc11 since the recommendation was 1st issued in july 2013.', 'introduction------------in this report, we describe, based on combined epidemiological surveillance data and genetic typing of serogroup c meningococcal isolates, the spread of a specific invasive strain of meningococcus c (menc) in the paris region that had started as an outbreak among men who have sex with men (msm) in june 2013.', 'the alert in june 2013----------------------in the 1st half of 2013, 14 serogroup c imd [invasive meningococcal disease] cases were reported in france in 25 to 59 year-old men, while 6 cases were reported in women. of the adult male cases, 6 affected residents of the paris region and 3 occurred within one week in early june in msm. the variable regions 1 and 2 of pora, the variable region of feta and the clonal complex (cc) of the 3 isolates were characterised. these isolates showed the genotype c:p1.5-1,10-8:f:3-6:cc11 and belonged to the electrophoretic type (et) 15 of the cc11 (cc11 harbours several lineages). between october 2012 and may 2013, 5 serogroup c imd cases in msm were also reported in germany [1], caused by isolates sharing the same characteristics as the ones in france. further genetic analysis showed that the german and the french isolates shared additional markers that also differed from other lineages of the cc11 isolates (data not shown). these findings raised the question of the emergence of a new clone of serogroup c _neisseria meningitidis_ in the european msm community [2]. considering that serogroup c outbreaks occurred also among msm in canada in 2001 and in the united states in 2003 (chicago [illinois]) and in 2011-13 (new york city), a rapid risk assessment was prepared by the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) in july 2013 [3,4].', 'we established a national enhanced surveillance and prompted the regional public health officers to assess a possible link to the msm community for all cases infected by c:p1.5-1,10-8:f:3-6:cc11 isolates.', 'serogroup c invasive meningococcal disease cases in the paris region from july 2013 to december 2014--------------------------------------------------------------------------------since july 2013, 34 cases of serogroup c imd have been notified in the paris region and 2 other cases have been diagnosed in other countries but were very likely to be linked to a source of exposure in the paris region. among these 36 cases, 17 were 25 to 59 years old and 5 were aged 60 years and older. the case fatality rate was 17 percent (6/36). the male/female ratio was 1.6 (22/14) (table 1). none of the cases had been vaccinated against menc disease.', 'isolates from 29 of the 36 cases were subjected to a complete molecular analysis and 14 were related to the genotype c:p1.5-1,10-8:f3-6:cc11. among those 14, 9 isolates showed the above-mentioned additional specific markers (figure 1). they corresponded to 7 men (1 aged 15-24 years and 6 aged 25-59 years) and 2 women (one aged 25-59 years and 1 in the age group 60 years and older). 1 additional male case (15-24 years old) was epidemiologically linked to one of them (family cluster). these 10 cases were directly or indirectly linked to the msm community (4 cases aged 25-59 years who self-identified as msm and 6 who did not identify as msm but attended social venues associated with the gay community in the paris region).', 'incidence rates and risk evaluation-----------------------------------when considering all reported serogroup c imd cases for all age groups and both women and men, no excess of cases was observed in the paris region compared with the general population of france since july 2013. in contrast, we observed a gradual increase in the incidence of serogroup c imd in the paris region since 2013, a trend that was less marked elsewhere in france (figure 2).', 'moreover, imd caused by c:p1.5-1,10-8:f3-6:cc11 isolates have increased since 2011 particularly in the paris region where it represented about half (11/22) of the notified meningococcus c imd cases in 2014 (vs 12 percent elsewhere in france, p less than 10-3). during the period from 2011 to 2014, the mean annual reporting rate for these isolates was estimated at 0.05 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in the paris region (vs 0.02 elsewhere in france, p less than 10-3).', 'in order to estimate the incidence among msm in the paris region, we used as the denominator the estimated figures from the 2006 national survey on sexual behaviour [5]. about 175 000 men living in the paris region and aged 25 to 59 years reported sexual encounters with men at least once during their life.', 'taking into account the 4 cases notified in msm since july 2013, the incidence of serogroup c imd among 25 to 59 year-old msm (individuals older than 25 years are not targeted by the national vaccination programme) in the paris region was 2.28 per 100 000 person-years. the observed number of cases was 10 times greater than the expected number among men in this age group, if the incidence rate of c imd cases was the same in paris region than in all regions in france. no excess risk was demonstrated among men living in the paris region who did not identify as msm (table 2).', 'public health response and discussion-------------------------------------surveillance of invasive meningococcal disease (imd) in france relies on the mandatory reporting of cases to the french institute for public health surveillance (invs) and the characterisation of invasive strains at the national reference centre (nrc) for meningococci. combined epidemiological surveillance and genetic typing of meningococcal isolates highlighted an increase of invasive meningococcal disease among msm. these data suggested that the excess of serogroup c imd cases among msm living in the paris region was linked to the circulation since mid-2013 of c:p1.5-1,10-8:f3-6:cc11 isolates with additional specific markers, not only in msm but also among individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as msm) who attend social venues associated with the gay community. following the 1st outbreak reported in june 2013, the french council of public health (hcsp) issued a recommendation for a 3-month period of vaccination, with a meningococcal conjugate c vaccine offered to all msm aged 25 years and older, living in the paris region and attending social venues associated with the gay community. this recommendation also included all individuals attending gay festivals during summer 2013 in france [6]. several health promotion activities were carried out during that summer by associations well-known in the gay community in france, but no vaccination campaign was officially performed. no data are available on the vaccine coverage reached in the targeted population.', 'moreover, data from national surveillance highlighted that 2 family clusters of 2 cases each were also reported outside the paris region in 2014, indicating that such isolates may spread all over the country and not only in the paris region. because of the high serogroup c imd incidence due to the c:p1.5-1,10-8:f3-6:cc11 isolates and the persistence of cases linked to the msm community, the recommendation was renewed in november 2014 for one year and extended beyond the paris region to the whole country, targeting msm and all individuals aged 25 years and older attending social venues associated with the gay community [7]. vaccination against serogroup c meningococci had been recommended in france since 2010 at the age of 12 months, with a catch-up in children and young adults (13 months to 24 years old). however, the incidence of serogroup c imd gradually increased between 2010 and 2013, mostly in infants younger than one year and in adults [8]. this increase suggested a lack of vaccine-induced herd immunity to reduce circulation of serogroup c meningococci, caused by low vaccine uptake (56 percent at the age of 2 years and 17 percent among the 15 to 19 year-olds in 2013).', 'vaccine policy for targeting 1 to 24 year-olds should be strengthened more efficiently in france. in addition, enhanced microbiological and epidemiological surveillance should be currently maintained for the isolates responsible of continuous spread of invasive menc among msm and adults older than 25 years attending social venues associated with the gay community.', '[tables, figures and references are available at the source url.]', '--communicated by:promed-mail <promed@promedmail.org>', '[_neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive

summer 2016, in a northwest european region extending over belgium, the netherlands and the eastern border of the german state of north rhine westphalia, an outbreak of wild bird deaths occurred similar to those reported on the continent since 1996. dead birds were necropsied and examined by complementary methods. pathologic and immunohistological investigations strongly suggested an infection by usutu virus. subsequently, genomic segments of the said virus were detected, the virus was isolated and its complete genome was sequenced. the strain, designated usutu-liege, is a close

received samples and photos of the algae on tuesday, he said.', '\"the reason signs didn\\'t go up straight away is because we didn\\'t actually have signs for cyanobacteria in the wanaka depot, dr

confirm what we are dealing with. certainly we will be learning from this and we will have signs in wanaka.\\'\\'', 'he said the algae was the result of high temperatures and low rivers.', '\"it has just been a total lack of floods for a number of months, so this is an exceptional set of circumstances.\\'\\'', '[there are a number of very toxic blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. the toxin may be present even if the algae are not, and likewise the algae may be present but the toxin may not be. however, safety for humans and animals means avoiding bodies of water with any blue-green algae.', '\"there are a number of blue-green algae, many of which are toxic, frequently resulting in rapid death for animals. blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of photosynthetic bacteria that many people refer to as \\'pond scum.\\' blue-green algae are most often blue-green in color, but can also be blue, green, reddish-purple, or brown. blue-green algae generally grow in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams when the water is warm and enriched with nutrients like phosphorus or nitrogen.', '\"when environmental conditions are just right, blue-green algae can grow very quickly. most species are buoyant and will float to the surface, where they form scum layers or floating mats. when this happens, we call this a \\'blue-green algae bloom.\\' blue-green algae blooms generally occur between mid-june and late september, although in rare instances, blooms have been observed in winter, even under the ice.', '\"many different species of blue-green algae occur, but the most commonly detected include _anabaena_ sp, _aphanizomenon_ sp, _microcystis_ sp, and _planktothrix_ sp. it is not always the same species that blooms in a given water body, and the dominant species can change over the course of the season.', '\"blue-green algal toxins are naturally produced chemical compounds that sometimes are produced inside the cells of certain species of blue-green algae. these chemicals are not produced all of the time, and there is no easy way to tell when blue-green algae are producing them and when they are not. when the cells are broken open, the toxins may be released. sometimes this occurs when the cells die off naturally and they break open as they sink and decay in a lake or pond. cells may also be broken open when the water is treated with chemicals meant to kill algae, and when cells are swallowed and mixed with digestive acids in the stomachs of people or animals.', '\"typical clinical signs in dogs exposed to blue-green algae include seizures, vomiting, and/or diarrhea after contact with surface water. although the water appears clear, if a \\'bloom\\' is just starting, it may be difficult to see any sheen, an early indication of blue-green algae formation. some forms of blue-green algae may start forming slightly below the surface and may not be visible, but are just as toxic.', '\"1 toxic alga frequently involved in illness and deaths is _microcystis aeruginosa_, a single-celled blue green alga, or cyanobacterium, that occurs naturally in surface waters. microcystis can proliferate to form dense blooms and mats under certain conditions. many variants of these cyanobacteria produce multiple toxins, including the potent liver toxin microcystin. when microcystis die, their cells break open, releasing the toxin microcystin into the water. ingestion of water or algal cells containing microcystin has produced adverse effects in fish, dogs, cats, livestock, and humans. sometimes the mats and the sheen of the organisms are visible on the surface of the water, if it is a pond. in larger bodies of water, such as large lakes, it may be more difficult or impossible to see the sheen or the mat of accumulation.', '\"people swimming in dense microcystis blooms have experienced irritation such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth. ingestion or inhalation of water containing dense bloom material may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. ingestion of significant levels of the toxin microcystin can cause liver damage and dysfunction in humans and animals. no deaths from ingestion of microcystins have been reported in humans in the us; however, brazil has reported human deaths. dogs, wildlife, and livestock have died following exposure to this toxin.', '\"microcystis blooms typically thrive in warm, turbid, and slow-moving waters. the blooms with the highest biomass occur in waters that are high in nitrogen or phosphorus (eutrophic waters). microcystis also requires sufficient light intensity to conduct photosynthesis, which results in blooms.', '\"the commonest route of exposure to microcystin is drinking water, followed by recreational exposures and food supplements. typical water treatment processes do not fully remove microcystin that might be present in drinking water supplies stored in reservoirs. swimming and playing in water that contains, or recently contained, microcystis blooms is another common exposure route. children have the highest risk of exposure since they tend to unintentionally ingest water while swimming. microcystin can move through the aquatic food web, exposing fish and shellfish, as well as the people who consume them. microcystin does not remain in edible fish and shellfish tissues for more than a few weeks. however, people who frequently consume sport fish caught from a water body that supports microcystis blooms have a higher risk of exposure. dogs can ingest large amounts of microcystis cells when they clean their coats after playing in water. livestock, wildlife, and dogs are exposed through drinking water containing microcystis or through ingesting algal mats.\"', 'toxins produced by blue-green algae----toxins are compounds that have a harmful effect on other cells, tissues and organisms. in the natural environment, these toxins are generally contained within the blue-green algal cell but they are released into the water when the cell is damaged or dies.', 'blue-green algal toxins can be divided into the following groups:', '1. hepatotoxins- hepatotoxins cause blood to collect in the liver causing circulatory shock and can lead to death by internal hemorrhaging.- hepatotoxins can cause weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea.- nodularin and microcystin are 2 types of hepatotoxins.- nodularin is produced by the algal species _nodularia spumigena_.- in nsw [new south wales, australia], microcystin is produced by _microcystis_.- microcystins can bioaccumulate in aquatic invertebrates such as mussels so aquatic animals caught from water where there is an algal bloom should not be eaten.', '2. neurotoxins- neurotoxins interfere with the functioning of the nervous system and can cause death of humans and animals within minutes by causing paralysis of the respiratory muscles.- in nsw, a neurotoxin known as saxitoxin is produced by the blue-green alga _anabaena_.- marine dinoflagellates (red tides) produce saxitoxins (also known as paralytic shellfish poisons) which concentrate in shellfish and have been known to cause death in humans.', '3. non-specific toxins- cylindrospermopsin is a non-specific toxin that in nsw is produced by the blue-green algae _cylindrospermopsis raciborskii_ and _aphanizomenon ovalisporum_.- this toxin is a relatively slow-acting toxin that damages most organs in the body including the liver.', '4. dermatoxic lipopolysachharides- when non-toxic species of blue-green algae are present at concentrations above 10 cubic mm per litre, the water may still pose a risk to recreational and domestic users as all blue-green algae have lipopolysachharides in their cell walls.- lipopolysachharides are less toxic than hepatotoxins or neurotoxins but are significant in terms of water supply for drinking, showering and recreation.- lipopolysachharides have been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis, skin and eye irritations and hay fever, in humans who have come into contact with algal blooms. humans who contact lipopolysachharides in the aerosol form (fine spray e.g. sprinkler) may suffer asthma, eczema, and blisters in the lining of the nose and mouth.']", "qas": [{"question": "what is the disease reported?", "id": "198", "answers": [{"answer_start": 79, "text": "toxic algae "}]},

medical director at the iu health center. \"we will contact campus and community members who may have been exposed, but we also want our students and staff to review their own immunization history and take appropriate steps.\"', 'students at indiana university are required to have 2 doses of the mmr vaccine -- and the documentation to prove it -- before enrolling for their 2nd semester of classes. it is requested that all students receive their vaccines before arriving on campus, but some receive them in the following weeks.', 'in addition to notifying people who may have been exposed, vaccines will also be made available to them if needed through a partnership between iu and the indiana state department of health. the federal clery act also requires indiana university to notify students and staff on the bloomington campus about the measles case and how to protect themselves. measles is caused by a virus, so it is not treatable with antibiotics, but the same hygiene practices that can help prevent the spread of influenza and other contagious diseases can help prevent the spread of measles.', '\"frequent handwashing throughout the day and sneezing or coughing into tissues or your elbow help prevent the spread of many serious communicable diseases, including measles,\" ebling said. \"this is particularly important in classroom and shared living and dining spaces.\"', 'the best protection and way to prevent measles is to have had 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (mmr). two doses are about 97 percent effective against measles. if you are unsure of your vaccination records, check with your primary-care provider. even a single dose of mmr up to 72 hours after exposure to someone with measles can prevent it or greatly reduce symptoms.', 'it can take anywhere from 10 -- 21 days after a person comes in contact with someone with measles for that person to develop symptoms. these typically begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, followed by a rash that typically spreads from the head to the rest of the body. in some cases, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth 2 --3 days after the onset of symptoms. common complications for measles include ear infections and diarrhea, seen in about 10 percent of patients.', 'a person is contagious 4 days before the appearance of rash and the 4 days after the onset of rash. the highly contagious virus spreads easily by coughing, sneezing or even being in the same room with an infected person.', 'because there is no cure, treatment is geared toward alleviating symptoms. rest, pain and fever reducers, fluids, vitamin a supplements, and the use of a humidifier are often recommended.', 'health authorities declared measles eliminated in the u.s. in 2000, but it is still common in other parts of the world.', 'the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has updated their 2018 watch level 1 travel alert status for countries experiencing measles outbreaks.', 'on [mon 8 jan 2018], the cdc has issued a watch level 1 status for the following countries: indonesia, romania, ukraine, italy, democratic republic of congo.', 'in the united states, most measles cases result from international travel. the disease is brought into the united states by people who get infected in other countries.', 'a 2017 study found that more than half the measles cases imported to the u.s. were from adult travelers who were not immune to the disease prior to traveling abroad.', 'of u.s. adult travelers who presented pre-travel consultation, 16 percent met criteria for measles, mumps, and rubella (mmr) vaccination, but fewer than 50 percent of these travelers were vaccinated.', 'before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 -- 4 million people got measles each year in the united states.', 'the cdc recommends that international travelers protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles with the mmr (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.', 'the mmr vaccine is very safe and effective. two doses of mmr vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93 percent effective, reports the cdc.', 'before departure from the united states, infants (6 through 11 months of age) should have one dose of mmr vaccine, and adults and children over one year of age should have 2 doses of mmr vaccine separated by at least 28 days.', 'measles is a disease caused by a virus that is spread through the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. measles virus is highly contagious and can remain so for up to 2 hours in the air or on surfaces.', 'since the cost estimates for treating a measles case ranges up to $181 679, getting the mmr vaccination is a less expensive preventative measure.', 'clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally, says the cdc.', 'in the usa, merck is the manufacturer of 2 mumps vaccinations. mmr and proquad both contain the protection for mumps, as well as protection for measles and rubella.', '[vaccines are one of the most important scientific inventions of all time, preventing millions of cases of disease every year and helping to consign once-deadly outbreaks to history. yet these vital public-health tools are under threat from

[1] however, positive findings have not been substantiated by controlled trials. few immunoglobulins are licensed for infectious disease and passive transfer is not without some attendant risks (appendix [available at original publication]). heterologous equine and ovine immune globulins can induce hypersensitivity; fab and f(ab\\')2, which have shorter in-vivo half-lives, lessen hypersensitivity, suggesting this hypersensitivity is largely mediated by foreign fc. although human igg is desirable, the risk of transmitting unidentified pathogens and costly donor screening protocols are barriers to use of fractionated human immune plasma products. for example, clinical studies of anti-mers intravenous immunoglobulin reported difficulty identifying human plasma donors because of low neutralising titres in convalescent patients and the generally short-lived nature of neutralising antibody responses after coronavirus infection.[2]', '\"in the lancet infectious diseases, john beigel and colleagues report results from a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of the safety and tolerability of sab-301, a fully human polyclonal igg developed from plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with mers spike protein nanoparticles. [3] the transchromosomic cattle used to produce sab-301 were developed over the course of a decade in a remarkable feat of genetic engineering (figure). in research studies, multiple vaccine platforms have generated antigen-specific human igg in transchromosomic cattle. hyperimmunisation of transchromosomic cattle with anthrax protective antigen yields human neutralising antibodies that protect mice against anthrax challenge.[4] additionally, dna vaccination yields human neutralising antibodies with demonstrated efficacy after passive transfer to rodent models of ebola virus and hantavirus infection. [5] ; [6] immunisation with recombinant nanoparticles used in the production of sab-301 or with gamma-irradiated whole-killed virions induced anti-mers neutralising human igg in transchromosomic cattle, which reportedly reduce lung viral load in a non-lethal murine mers challenge.[7]', '\"in their study, beigel and colleagues show that human participants who received infusion of sab-301 developed anti-mers neutralising antibody titres that correlated with serum sab-301 concentrations. these titres were achieved without clinically significant hypersensitivity or adverse events at infusion rates below current intravenous immunoglobulin guidelines. the sab-301 terminal elimination half-life appears to be within range of a typical human antibody. sab-301 is enriched in human igg1\u00ee\u00ba, which could exhibit important in-vivo effector-mediated functions in addition to demonstrated in-vitro neutralising capability.[8] the effect of bovine processes on sab-301 human igg development is unclear. comparative immunology of human beings and cattle point to several key innate immune factors--namely, anatomical (eg, a primary lymphoid organ in the bovine intestine referred to as an ileal peyer\\'s patch[9]), cellular (eg, abundant bovine circulatory \u00ee\u00b3\u00ee\u00b4 t cells with unique capabilities[10]), and molecular (eg, bovine pattern recognition receptor function[11]) factors, which could lead to distinct adaptive immunity. post-translational modifications, including glycosylation,4 could lead to dissimilar effector functions between transchromosomic igg and human igg, and will require additional work to be understood. transchromosomic cattle reportedly make 150-600 g of human igg per animal per month,[7] thus more than 6500 cows would be needed to produce an immediate 50 mg/kg dose of unfractionated human igg for one million adults. potent, functional, antigen-specific antibody generation through optimised vaccination protocols will be crucial for environmental and economic feasibility of this platform. the therapeutic and protective efficacy of sab-301 in human infection or lethal animal challenge has not been reported, underscoring that this is an early technology requiring further clinical investigation.', '\"vitality in the field of antibodies deployed against infectious diseases is supported by the concomitant rise in systems for rapid delivery of rigorously selected and highly potent monoclonal antibodies as proteins, dna, or rna, as well as vectored delivery. additional technologies addressing the need for sustainable, potent antibody therapies include engineered bispecific antibodies and half-life extension modifications. the study of transchromosomic cattle with the ability to produce polyclonal

different from all previously known bornaviruses. at the moment, it is not known whether these are isolated cases.', 'it cannot be ruled out that the diseases of the 3 patients could have been caused

preventive measure, direct contact with variegated squirrels should be avoided. if a variegated squirrel develops disease or dies of unknown causes, the owner should inform the veterinarian, who, if necessary, can then initiate further investigations.', \"in connection with the fli's and the bnitm's discovery of this new, possibly zoonotic bornavirus, it still needs to be clarified whether the

infects humans at least occasionally and has its suspected host among small wild mammals. animal borna disease (bd) has classically been described as a chronic, progressive meningoencephalomyelitis, causing both neurological and behavioural symptoms in horses and sheep. during recent decades, milder manifestations and a wider host range have also been seen. in humans, numerous neuropsychiatric entities have been reported to be associated with potential markers of bdv infection, but the evidence remains inconclusive, and the true prevalence and causative role are questionable.', 'the above information, and the following (edited) chapter \"ecology and epidemiology\", are summarised from a comprehensive review (ref 1), where the deleted references can be found.', '\"ecology and epidemiology1. geographical distributionsigns of bdv infection, including antibodies, antigen, rna and/or virus itself, have been reported from animals in many continents. the highest clinical incidence of bd in animals manifesting neurological bdv infection verified by virus isolation is restricted to central europe. in other countries (in europe, asia, usa, australia), the possible activity of the virus has been demonstrated by antibody, rna and/or antigen findings; see map in the referenced review (ref 1). although it seems probable that not all bdv reports are reproducible, the virus or its close relative is distributed widely. whether some of the findings are in fact caused by abvs, endogenized bornavirus genes, or as-yet-unknown bornaviruses remains to be shown.', '2. species diversitybdv has long been known to infect and cause disease in horses. later, natural infections with bdv or a bdv-like agent were also verified in humans, various herbivores (sheep, goat, cow, deer, llama, alpaca, rabbit, pygmy hippopotamus) as well as dog, cat, monkey, sloth, lynx and, recently, the shrew. evidence also exists of infections in ostrich, fox, mallard and jackdaw, wild voles, macaque and raccoon. in addition, this neurotropic virus experimentally infects tree shrew, rhesus monkey, chicken, rat, mouse, hamster, mongolian gerbil, guinea pig and bank vole. despite the wide possible host range, the incidence of bd in species other than horses and sheep appears low. as a sporadic and relatively poorly known disease, bd commonly seems to escape diagnosis.', '3. human bd?as bdv infects a wide variety of animal species with a predilection for the limbic system, and occasionally induces persistent emotional, cognitive and behavioural alterations in experimental animals, including primates and their ancestors, tree shrews (_tupaia glis_), the question has arisen of whether the virus could also be a human pathogen and cause neuropsychiatric disorders. the 1st evidence of human infections was reported in 1985: 0.43-12.5 per cent of patients with diverse psychiatric disorders had bdv antibodies in serum, whereas the seroprevalence in the control group was 0.5 per cent. the seropositive patients were diagnosed to have a primary major depressive disorder. the majority of later studies have also reported higher bdv marker prevalence in some patient groups than in controls -- that is, in unspecified psychiatric inpatients, neurotic, personality adjustment and mood-disorder patients, schizophrenics and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. however, signs of infection are not present in all patient groups, and control or comparison groups also sometimes harbour signs of bdv infection. furthermore, despite the association of detected bdv markers with some psychiatric diseases in numerous (but not all) studies, conclusions on the causal relationships are impossible to draw. the situation is even more complicated by the facts that no consensus exists on the method that should be used for bdv diagnosis and that, based on sequence identity, many pcr results and even virus isolation from human peripheral blood cells have been suspected to have arisen from contamination by a control strain. a recent (2012) study using extremely tight criteria for bdv positivity found neither bdv rna nor verifiable bdv antibodies in the blood samples of californian psychiatric patients.', 'despite the controversies, there are researchers who consider that the existence of potential \"human bd\" has been demonstrated and is common. especially controversial, however, are their findings based on the triple-elisa method. in addition, other serological bdv methods also have been suspected to produce unspecific results; this suspicion seems to be commoner for bdv than for other viral infections. nonetheless, a very few human bdv infections have been carefully documented with a combination of reproducible and controlled methods. this suggests that bdv can indeed infect humans, but the frequency of human infections, the role of endogenized bornaviral genes and, most importantly, the existence of potential human bd are still questionable.\"', 'the rodent variegated squirrel (_sciurus variegatoides_) is a tree squirrel in the genus _sciurus_ endemic to central america (costa rica, el salvador, guatemala, honduras, southern mexico, nicaragua, and panama). there are 14 sub-species. the variegated squirrel can be kept as an exotic pet; a picture is at http://www.naturephoto-cz.com/variegated-squirrel-photo-7388.html.', 'the following information has been provided by the ecdc. borna disease virus (bdv) infections were 1st described in the 18th century and were named after the town of borna, near leipzig, germany, where an epizootic condition was described in 1885 among military horses, monkeys, and ostriches. bdv related avian bornaviruses (abv) have been recently described in psittacine birds, canada geese, trumpeter and mute swans, and canary birds.', 'animal bdv infections have been described in central europe, the united kingdom, israel, japan, sweden, finland, australia, and the united states of america. in 2000 in austria, nowotny and colleagues described a new subtype of bdv isolated from a horse that was euthanized due to severe and incurable neurological disease. the new subtype differed from the reference strains by more than 15 per cent and was difficult to detect by standard reverse transcriptase pcr protocols. this indicated that the genome of bdv is far more variable than previously assumed and that naturally occurring subtypes may escape detection by currently used diagnostic assays.', 'in animals, bdv infection may lead to an acute or sub-acute disease with meningo-encephalitis or mild manifestations with alteration or impairment of nerve-cell functions. the specific disease syndromes depend on many host factors including the species, breed, age, and immunological status of the animal at the time of infection. in classical borna disease, paralysis is common, and death occurs within 5 weeks in the majority of animals. recovery is possible with life-long altered behaviour. avian bornaviruses are the causative agents of pro-ventricular dilatation disease, a fatal neurological disease considered to be a major threat to psittacine bird populations. small wild animals are the most probable vectors and reservoirs of bdv infection, although the epidemiology is not fully understood. arthropods and birds have also been investigated as possible bdv reservoirs.', 'the first evidence of possible human infections with bornaviruses resulted from a study published in 1985 showing that patients with major depressive psychiatric disorders had a higher bornavirus-related seroprevalence as compared with the control groups. the majority of later studies also reported the higher seroprevalence or other bdv markers in patients presenting with diverse psychiatric disorders. however, it was not possible to infer the causal relationship between bdv infection and psychiatric disorder because of the occasional presence of the infectious markers in control patient groups, proven viral contamination of laboratory samples, and the disagreement on diagnostic methods for bdv. however, very few studies that employed a combination of reproducible and controlled methods suggest that bdv infection in humans is possible. nevertheless, the frequency of human infections, the role of endogenised bornavirus genes, and the existence of potential human bd are still uncertain.', 'taxonomically, borna disease viruses are classified as negative-strand rna viruses. this classification been complicated by the detection of endogenous

\"record number of cures unloaded in butembo---------------------during the week of 1 apr 2019, 17 cured patients were discharged from the butembo cte, a record never before achieved. dr. richard kitenge, national coordinator of cte and country leader for ebola virus disease (evd), hopes that this good news will help change people's perceptions of etc. in the town of butembo, many patients avoided or refused to be transferred to the etc for fear of dying there. thus, the patients arrived at the cte at an advanced stage of the disease too late to be able to be saved.- despite the persistence of a high rate of community deaths in butembo town, it has been observed that an increasing number of sick people detected in the community or local health facilities agree to be transferred to the cte soon after early symptoms, thus increasing their chance of survival. as a reminder, 80% of patients (i.e., 8 out of 10 patients) who were taken care of less than 3 days after the onset of symptoms have come out of etcs.- since the reopening of the katwa and butembo ctes, changes have been made in the medical management of patients. the capacity of the butembo cte is now 94 beds, and that of the katwa cte is 76 beds.\", \"-at the butembo cte, the number of nursing staff increased from 62 to 90 nurses and from 14 to 32 physicians, all recruited locally. the caregivers were divided into 3 teams: a team exclusively responsible for admissions to reduce the waiting time for patients arriving at the cte, a team for monitoring patients in stable condition, and a last larger team for follow-up of patients in critical condition. for patients in serious condition, psychologists are assigned to families to accompany them throughout the process. psychologists serve as a link between cte families and doctors to explain the evolution of the patient's medical situation in a simple and regular way to families. families of patients are allowed to visit their sick relatives every day with the support of the health promotion teams. in addition, the therapeutic molecules are used again but in the context of the former therapeutic protocol for compassionate purposes and no longer in the context of the clinical trial.\", 'vaccination------------since vaccination began on 8 aug 2018, 97 035 people have been vaccinated.', 'today [wed 10 apr 2019] the

of international concern.', 'the panel, which 1st met on this issue in october 2018, will also give updated recommendations on how global health officials should manage the outbreak, the who said in a statement from its geneva headquarters.', 'at least 740 people have died among the more than 1100 infected in this epidemic, which began in august 2018.', 'declaring the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" or pheic, would ramp up the international response with a formal alert that puts governments on notice and helps to mobilize resources and research.', 'the who said that while the outbreak is contained to the provinces of north kivu and ituri, efforts to bring it under control in these urban areas have been hampered by security and access problems. as a result, it said, ebola transmission has increased in some areas.', '\"though the risk of spread within the country and to neighboring countries is very high, the risk remains low globally,\" the who statement added.', \"the emergency panel's meeting will take place on friday [12 apr 2019], and its decision will be published late the same day.\", 'as the democratic republic of congo\\'s (drc\\'s) 10th outbreak of ebola virus disease (evd) rages in this resource-limited, war-torn region, advances in the delivery of supportive care and the introduction of investigational therapies provide a glimmer of hope amid the mounting infections. in the absence of effective therapies or vaccines, evd outbreak response has centered around the most basic of public health principles: identification and isolation of patients with suspected and confirmed evd and tracking of all the contacts of the confirmed patients, who are then rapidly isolated if they show signs of disease. this strategy of \"identify, isolate, and track\" allows public health responders to curtail and eventually eliminate virus transmission in the community and has been the foundation of evd outbreak-control efforts since the disease was 1st described in 1976.', 'strategies for protecting susceptible communities have not always benefited patients, however. within what were once routinely called evd isolation units -- now known as ebola treatment units -- supportive care was typically limited to the most basic measures, such as providing oral rehydration salts and acetaminophen. unsurprisingly, case fatality ratios were high, which fueled community mistrust and resistance to broader outbreak-control efforts. the prolonged 2013-2016 evd outbreak in west africa allowed for an evolution of care that, by the time the outbreak was declared over, saw many patients receiving intravenous volume repletion, antibiotics, and antimalarials, potentially contributing to the downward trend in case fatality ratios. in effect, as the epidemic waned, a new standard of care emerged, along with the important and enduring lesson that substantial progress in the clinical care of patients with evd was not only possible but most likely essential to improving patient outcomes.', 'it should no longer be acceptable to have 2 standards of care: one for patients in resource-constrained settings and another for those in countries where resources are more readily available. the ongoing response to evd is teaching us that higher standards are no longer aspirational but are possible, and that during inevitable future outbreaks of evd, no matter how remote the setting, we can provide people who are sick and suffering with the type of care that we would want to receive.', 'on 9 apr [2019], the union of oppressed women (ufo) launched an awareness campaign for 300 \"street children\" against the ebola virus. several sites in the communes of goma and nyiragongo have been targeted. the ngo ufo justifies this activity by the vulnerability of this social stratum in the city of goma and the territory of nyiragongo, with the outbreak of the epidemic that has already [affected] more than 1000 people.', 'jeanne kamitiango, coordinator of the ufo, talks about the strategy to sensitize these children, most of whom cannot read or write: \"we have leaflets, we will show them signs, we will show them how to take care of their hands . . .\"', 'this awareness campaign involves more than 3000 \"street children\" living in the 2 communes of goma and the neighboring territory of nyiragongo.', 'there was hope that an experimental ebola vaccine, made by merck, would help to contain the outbreak. and who officials insist that, but for the vaccine, this outbreak would be many times more severe than it already is. more than 97 000 doses of the vaccine have been administered so far in this outbreak.', \"but failings of the response are undermining the vaccine's effectiveness. the vaccine is being used in what is called a ring vaccination approach: it is being offered to people who are known contacts of cases and the contacts of the contacts, as well as health workers and other frontline workers. the idea is to prevent spread of the virus by protecting people who are in contact with cases.\", 'for that approach to work, the ebola response needs to be able to identify as many contacts as possible. but in many cases, they have been unable to do the contact tracing work needed to draw up detailed lists; cases have occurred in neighborhoods or villages where it is unsafe for them to work. as a result, many people who should have been vaccinated have not appeared on the vaccination list.', 'the prolonged length of this outbreak has raised concerns that supplies of the vaccine might run out. merck has promised to try to maintain a stockpile of 300 000 doses. at the time that figure was struck, 300 000 doses seemed like a large cushion. but this outbreak has made it clear the size of the stockpile will need to be revisited.', 'knowledge gained following the 2014-16 west africa ebola outbreak identified a number of challenges survivors face, including reduced or blurred vision stemming from inflammation of their eyes. about 20% of survivors from that outbreak had some form of eye problem.', 'by identifying and treating these problems early, serious consequences, including blindness, can be averted. with the ministry of health of the democratic republic of the congo (drc), the world health organization recently organized an eye clinic to check on the eye health of survivors of the current ebola outbreak.', 'the clinic was held in beni, drc, one of the affected areas, from 25 mar to 1 apr [2019]. in addition, an eye clinic in butembo, another affected area, was equipped so that they can provide this specialized care to survivors there. this is the 1st time in an ebola outbreak that follow-up for eye care has happened so soon after survivors have been released from care.', 'several survivors also helped with the planning and administration of the clinic. partners in this project include emory university, which deployed 2 ophthalmologists, and university of north carolina, which deployed one ophthalmologist to the project via the global outbreak alert and response network, which is hosted by who.', 'over 250 survivors were seen. the team noted that complications such as uveitis were observed at lower rates compared to cases from the 2014-2016 west africa ebola outbreak. so far only one survivor had eye complications that may be linked to ebola.', 'as part of the programme, international specialists trained 10 congolese ophthalmologists on how to identify and treat ebola-related eye issues. feedback from participating national healthcare providers and enrolled survivors was overwhelmingly positive.', 'next steps will be to continue to follow up with survivors at the clinics held each month, where they are provided medical,

viruses. the most common are respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza viruses, and influenza virus, which occur in the colder months of the year. enteroviruses occur during the warmer summer

continue to spread the virus for 1 to 3 weeks. rsv most commonly causes upper rtis (such as a cold-like illness, bronchitis, or croup), but lower rtis (such as bronchiolitis, which is inflammation of the small airways of the lungs, or pneumonia, which can become life-threatening) more likely occurs in infants. the risk of severe rsv infection is greatest for premature infants, children with heart or lung disease, immune deficient children, and children under 8 to 10 weeks of age. some children with severe rsv are treated with an aerosolized drug called ribavirin. there is no vaccine to prevent rsv infection, but palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent rsv infections during rsv season in infants and young children who have a higher risk for serious illness caused by rsv.',

in british cattle caused by _mycobacterium bovis_ has only sporadically affected companion animals. between december 2012 and march 2013, 7 laboratory confirmed cases of _m. bovis_ infection in cats were seen at one veterinary clinic in newbury, berkshire, uk. 2 more cats with suspected _m. bovis_ infection were identified in the same time frame. all 9 cats were from separate households and lived within a 5 km [3.1 mi] radius; 6 lived within a 250 m [0.2 mi] radius.', 'main conclusion---------------the most likely source of infection for at least some of the cats is infected wildlife -- probably rodents and/or badgers. genotyping showed that the polymorphism in these cat isolates reflects the polymorphism found in the local cattle/wildlife population and supports the idea that cats are occasional spillover hosts for _m. bovis_ from a local wildlife or cattle reservoir.', 'approach--------traditional field epidemiological investigations were conducted to characterise this incident. isolates from local cats, cattle, and an alpaca were genotyped. selected isolates were whole genome sequenced.', 'results-------a history of likely bite wounds in 4 cases, and popliteal lymphadenitis (possibly due to distal hindlimb inoculation) in 3 others, offers a route of infection through biting for 7 out of the 9 cases. all _m. bovis_ isolates from the culture-positive cats were of the rare 10:u genotype, previously identified in another cat, an alpaca, and 21 cattle herd breakdowns from the same area since 2008. whole genome sequence of the 10:u isolates from cats and cattle showed common characteristics suggesting that at least 2 transmissions had occurred into these cats from local wildlife/cattle.', 'interpretation--------------it is impossible to be more precise about the exact origin of infection for the cats in this cluster, but the balance of evidence and our knowledge of the way in which this disease spreads suggests that a wildlife/environmental source is more likely than a cattle source.', 'significance of findings------------------------most cases of tuberculous disease in cats caused by _m. bovis_ are sporadic and diagnosed in areas of endemic infection in cattle and wildlife. the incident reported here was unusual and does not change the view that cats represent occasional spillover hosts of the bacterium, playing a limited role in the epidemiology of bovine tb in great britain. nevertheless, the infection in cats can give rise to a serious and potentially zoonotic disease. therefore, practitioners should remain alert for (and seek differential bacteriological diagnosis of) suspected mycobacterial disease in cats.', 'ref: gunn-moore d: feline tuberculosis caused by _mycobacterium bovis_. vet rec. 2014 mar 29; 174(13): 322-3. doi: 10.1136/vr.g2338----------------------------------------------------------------------no one connected with farming or veterinary science could fail to know that bovine tb caused by _mycobacterium bovis_ is a major problem in cattle in great britain, especially in the west of england and wales and, unfortunately, that its prevalence is increasing. most people are also aware that _m. bovis_ infects badgers. however, people are generally less aware that in great britain, _m. bovis_ is now quite commonly found in cats, pigs, south american camelids (llamas and alpacas), and deer, and it can be found less frequently in many other species, including dogs, goats, sheep, feral mink, ferrets, rats, and mice. it is only by understanding the full complexity of _m. bovis_ ecology that we will eventually be able to control it.', '_m. bovis_ infection in cats is of significant importance as feline tb is being recognised with increased frequency in great britain. approximately 1 per cent of feline tissue samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories for routine histopathology have been found to have changes consistent with mycobacteriosis and, when cultured, _m. bovis_ is identified in 15 per cent of these samples. infected cats are almost exclusively from the west of england and wales, co-incident with the areas where cattle, badgers, mice, and other small rodents are also infected.', '_m. bovis_-infected cats are very rarely seen elsewhere in great britain. unfortunately, while increasing numbers of cases of feline tb are being diagnosed, many veterinary surgeons still fail to recognise this condition. this is because, instead of presenting with wasting and a cough (as might be expected), cats with tb typically present with cutaneous lesions and/or lymphadenopathy. the skin lesions are single or multiple raised nodules, which may or may not be ulcerated, and/or have associated draining sinus tracts [fig 1 \"typical case of feline tuberculosis\" available in the original paper, subscription required. -mod.as]. extension of granulomatous tissue may involve subcutaneous structures, muscle, and/or bone, and lesions are commonly associated with either local or generalised lymphadenopathy. in some cases, local lymphadenopathy may be the only finding. chronic cases may progress to involve the lungs, with affected cats presenting with dyspnoea and, occasionally, a soft cough.', \"an important piece of work on feline tb, summarised on p 326 of this issue of veterinary record [see item 2 above], describes an unusual cluster of 9 cats with _m. bovis_ infection, which were all presented to the same small animal practice. the clinical signs were similar to those seen in other studies, with cutaneous lesions at 'fight and bite sites' and/or local lymphadenopathy (four cases had popliteal lymphadenopathy), with or without pulmonary signs (7 cases had interstitial pneumonia). however, what was unusual about these cats is that they all lived in very close proximity (within 5 km [3.1 mi]; 6 lived within a 250 m [0.2 mi] radius). while the epidemiology of feline _m. bovis_ infection is still unclear, it is currently thought that most cats are infected when bitten by _m. bovis_-infected small rodents while hunting. rodents probably become infected when visiting contaminated badger setts; the _m. bovis_ spoligotypes found in cats are the same as those found in cattle, badgers, and small rodents in any particular area. cats could also be infected via environmental contamination from infected badgers (or possibly deer), as _m. bovis_ can survive for extended periods in certain environments. while it is possible that badgers could directly infect cats, this is unlikely, as they rarely interact closely. drinking tuberculous milk is also unlikely as most cows' milk is pasteurised in great britain and infected cattle are removed early in infection (as reactor cattle), so tuberculous mastitis is rarely seen [comment].\", 'previously, cases have been reported where a number of cats within a single household have been infected, but in most cases the cats had little close contact with each other, and the infections appeared to result from hunting the same group of infected prey). however, a small number of cases have occurred in cats that did not go outside, but that lived with another cat (or in one case a dog) that was known to be infected and/or which went outside and hunted. these cases appear to represent spread via close contact, particularly sleeping with and grooming an infected companion. based on details in the short communication by roberts and others (2014), it is not possible to tell how these cats were infected, but the authors suggest it was via rodents and/or badgers. they also stated that cat-to-cat transmission could not be ruled out.', 'importantly, there has now been a small number of nosocomial cases, where cats naturally infected with _m. bovis_ have infected other cats via contamination within a veterinary practice, particularly during routine neutering.', 'all of the cats reported by roberts and others (2014) were seen within the same small animal veterinary clinic, and one developed a tuberculous lesion at the site of castration 3 weeks after the operation. i have seen this startlingly rapid progression in 2 confirmed nosocomial cases, with clinical signs arising as soon as 14 days after ovariohysterectomy and rapid progression to the point of euthanasia at 42 days after castration. rapid disease progression has previously been seen in experimental and naturally occurring infections, and may result from a large inoculation of _m. bovis_.', 'the information presented by roberts and others is important as it reinforces the evidence that feline tb is now a significant disease in cats in great britain. it shows that infection clusters can occur, probably resulting from interactions with wildlife. it also shows that failing to recognise these infections can result in nosocomial infection. all veterinary practitioners need to know how to recognise feline tb so they do not misdiagnose it, resulting in a poor prognosis for that particular cat, while also putting themselves and their other patients at risk of _m. bovis_ infection.', 'unfortunately, diagnosis is not always easy; specialist culture is the gold standard, but it can take many weeks. the interferon gamma test is proving helpful, but we urgently need rapid and accurate antemortem diagnostics so that these cats can be accurately identified as quickly as possible. what we then do is up for serious debate, as while _m. bovis_-infected cats can respond well to the correct treatment, there are no drugs licenced for the treatment of feline tb, and although rifampicin is usually given, some people feel that this antibiotic should be kept solely for the treatment of people with tb.', '--communicated by:promed-mail<promed@promedmail.org>', \"[the

wildlife sectors over several years, and is among the notifiable diseases. despite frequent anthrax outbreaks, there is no comprehensive dataset indicating the magnitude and distribution of the disease in susceptible species. this study is a retrospective review of anthrax outbreaks from the human, livestock, and wildlife surveillance systems from 2006 to 2016. the objectives were to identify hotspot districts, describe anthrax epidemiology in the hotspot areas, evaluate the efficiency of the anthrax response systems and identify potential areas for further observational studies.', 'methodswe prepared a spreadsheet template for a retrospective comprehensive record review at different surveillance levels in tanzania. we captured data elements including demographic characteristics of different species, the name of health facility, and date of anthrax diagnosis. also, we collected data on the date of specimen collection, species screened, type of laboratory test, laboratory results, and the outcome recorded at the end of treatment in humans. after establishing the database, we produced maps in quantum gis software and transferred cleaned data to stata software for supportive statistical analysis.', 'resultsanthrax reported incidences over 4 years in humans were much higher in the arusha region (7.88/100 000) followed by kilimanjaro region (6.64/100 000)

critical for consideration by respective authorities for setting up prevention and control measures of anthrax outbreaks in the human, livestock, and wildlife sectors within tanzania. there is a gross under-reporting of anthrax cases in existing human and animal surveillance systems, which can be an obstacle for estimating the real burden of anthrax in the hotspot districts. we also noticed that

large mers outbreak in a major tertiary care hospital in riyadh was thought to be related to emergency department overcrowding, uncontrolled patient movement, and high visitor traffic. the outbreak required institution of multiple measures to interrupt transmission, including almost complete shutdown of the hospital. primary mers cases have been linked to patients with camel exposure in previously described outbreaks (5) and exposure to camels was confirmed in 3 patients during the early stages of this outbreak. escalation of the outbreak, however, was clearly linked to extended health care-related person-to-person transmission. in addition to the community transmission, 4 generations of hospital transmission were believed to have occurred during the outbreak. although data are still limited, this occurrence is considered a more intense transmission than has been previously described in similar outbreaks (6). although the outbreak was associated with considerable patient mortality, no deaths occurred among health care workers, who were younger, healthier, and had fewer comorbidities compared with patients who were not health care workers. early recognition of cases and rapid implementation of infection control guidance is necessary to prevent health care facility-associated outbreaks of mers-cov.', '[in reading the above report, there appear to be similarities with the situation reported in the mers-cov outbreak in south korea during the period may-early july 2015 -- with transmission \"related to emergency department overcrowding, uncontrolled patient movement, and high visitor traffic\". closure of the emergency department seemed to be important to interrupt transmission of the mers-cov in the above outbreak as well as in the outbreak in south korea. interestingly as well, the above outbreak was associated with 4 generations of transmission of the mers-cov, also seen in the outbreak in south korea suggesting there have not been significant changes in transmission patterns and the epidemiology of the disease. noteworthy is the very high case fatality rate observed among non-health care workers -- although 21 of the cases were

organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism.', 'the ingestion of _v. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. the \"primary septicemia\" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. the organism can also enter through damaged skin. in these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html). - mod.ll']", "qas": [{"question": "what is the disease reported?", "id": "46",
