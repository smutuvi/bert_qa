problems in florida. as president of the hepatitis education awareness and liver support (heals) group of the south, one of the problems i encounter is the increasing number of drug users contracting hepatitis c due to the sharing of needles.', \"hepatitis c (hcv) is the most common chronic blood-borne disease, accounting for a large percentage of chronic liver disease. it's a leading cause of death in florida. at least 60 percent of hcv cases are caused by injection drug use, the cdc says.\", \"in florida, the number of cases of hcv increased 133 percent between 2009 and 2013. there's no doubt this is linked to the increased rate of drug abuse. we need to increase awareness around the issue of needle sharing and implement more tools to fight against users injecting drugs in the 1st place. one preventative measure is making available opioids with abuse-deterrent properties (oadp), which are prescription painkillers that are nearly impossible to melt and inject. because opiate use accounts for a large percentage of injection drug use, oadps could help to limit the hcv cases and have been proven to curb abuse.\", \"i call upon florida's lawmakers to adopt oadp in 2016 to fight drug abuse and the spread of hcv, which will save lives.\", 'abstract\"what is known and objective: pain is a prevalent and, due to the ageing population, increasing medical problem. opioids are frequently prescribed to meet the unmet medical need. unfortunately, with the increase in the legitimate use of opioids, there has been a corresponding increase in abuse. a practical way to retain the pain relief afforded by opioids while decreasing opportunities for abuse is to make it more difficult to extract the opioid from the product or to make it less desirable to do so by designing an abuse-deterrent formulation (adf). we provide a brief overview of the strategies and early evidence related to opioid adfs.', 'methods: published and unpublished literature, websites, and other sources were searched for current opioid formulation options, including immediate-release and extended-release products. each was summarized, reviewed and assessed.', 'results: the strategies that have been used to design the current opioid adfs involve one or more of 4 approaches: a physical barrier; incorporation of an opioid receptor antagonist (e.g. naloxone) that self-limits opioid action when taken in excess amount; inclusion of a noxious agent that is released during inappropriate use; or a pro-drug.', 'what is new and conclusions: legitimate use of opioid analgesics carries with it certain risks, including the risk of abuse. the new adfs utilize 4 major strategies and provide innovative additions to the armamentarium. they likely will become an important part of a comprehensive approach to limiting, although not eliminating, opioid misuse and abuse.\"', 'although these various opioid apf approaches have potential, below is a 2012 letter to the editor which points out a potential flaw in one form of apf:', 'to the editor:\"in august 2010, an abuse-deterrent formulation of the widely abused prescription opioid oxycontin was introduced. the intent was to make oxycontin more difficult to solubilize or crush, thus discouraging abuse through injection and inhalation. we examined the effect of the abuse-deterrent formulation on the abuse of oxycontin and other opioids.', \"data were collected quarterly from 1 jul 2009 through 31 mar 2012 with the use of self-administered surveys that were completed anonymously by independent cohorts of 2566 patients with opioid dependence, as defined by the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 4th edition, who were entering treatment programs around the united states and for whom a prescription opioid was the primary drug of abuse (i.e., heroin use was acceptable but could not be the patient's primary drug). of these patients, 103 agreed to online or telephone interviews to gather qualitative information in order to amplify and interpret findings from the structured national survey.\", 'as shown in figure 1 [for figures, see original url - mod.ll], the selection of oxycontin as a primary drug of abuse decreased from 35.6 percent of respondents before the release of the abuse-deterrent formulation to just 12.8 percent 21 months later (p less than 0.001). simultaneously, selection of hydrocodone and other oxycodone agents increased slightly, whereas for other opioids, including high-potency fentanyl and hydromorphone, selection rose markedly, from 20.1 percent to 32.3 percent (p=0.005). of all opioids used to \"get high in the past 30 days at least once\" (figure 1b), oxycontin fell from 47.4 percent of respondents to 30.0 percent (p less than 0.001), whereas heroin use nearly doubled.', 'interviews with patients who abused both formulations of oxycontin indicated a unanimous preference for the older version. although 24 percent found a way to defeat the tamper-resistant properties of the abuse-deterrent formulation, 66 percent indicated a switch to another opioid, with \"heroin\" the most common response. these changes appear to be causally linked, as typified by one response: \"most people that i know don\\'t use oxycontin to get high anymore. they have moved on to heroin [because] it is easier to use, much cheaper, and easily available.\" it is important to note that there was no evidence that oxycontin abusers ceased their drug abuse as a result of the abuse-deterrent formulation. rather, it appears that they simply shifted their drug of choice.', 'our data show that an abuse-deterrent formulation successfully reduced abuse of a specific drug but also generated an unanticipated outcome: replacement of the abuse-deterrent formulation with alternative opioid medications and heroin, a drug that may pose a much greater overall risk to public health than oxycontin. thus, abuse-deterrent formulations may not be the \"magic bullets\" that many hoped they would be in solving the growing problem of opioid abuse.\"', 'clearly a multipronged approach to this extremely important problem is needed. - mod.ll']", "qas": [{"question":

being found in just one location -- part of the most extreme die-off in 40 years, one expert says. in alaska, there are about 2.8 million breeding common murres, a land-averse seabird that dives as deep as 600 feet underwater to find prey, such as herring and capelin. thousands of murres were recently discovered dead on a beach in whittier, alaska, according to the associated press [ap]. others were emaciated, suggesting a change in diet that the murres could not handle.', '\"that\\'s unprecedented, that sheer number in one location is off the charts,\" said john piatt, research wildlife biologist at the us geological survey\\'s alaska science center, referring to the 8000 dead murres in whittier. piatt told the alaska dispatch news the die-off is \"the most extreme i have ever seen or heard of\" in 4 decades of research in the atlantic and pacific oceans.', \"federal researchers are trying to assess the extent of the die-off while stopping short of offering an estimate of how many have perished, the ap reported. researchers are planning to comb more alaska beaches for signs of murres in peril. last summer, murre carcasses were found throughout alaska, including on kodiak island, the alaska peninsula, and elsewhere. large accumulations of dead murres have appeared in homer's mud bay and kachemak bay, and elsewhere along coastal alaska as of late.\", '\"it\\'s turning out to be something that does have the potential for population-level effects,\" andrea medeiros, a spokeswoman for the fish and wildlife service, told alaska dispatch news. \"it is just off the chart as far as what we typically see with these events.\"', \"while winter storms can impact murres' hunting strategies, this die-off is showing signs of starvation likely caused by an extraordinary warming of surface water temperatures -- possibly due to climate change or an el nino weather pattern in the central pacific ocean -- that has diminished the populations of capelin and other forage fish sought after by murres.\", '\"if the water (temperature) goes above that threshold, they\\'re out of there,\" said biologist david irons, who noticed the mass die-off in whittier. \"they either die or they move.\"', 'many stranded murres have been collected by wildlife treatment outlets over the past year. a us geological survey examination of around 100 carcasses found no sign of parasites or disease that would suggest a cause for the latest die-off.', 'irons led a research effort in 2008 that showed a correlation between natural murre die-offs and rising ocean temperatures connected with climate change. when ocean surface-water temperatures rose a few degrees, murres showed depleted numbers, irons found. given no one monitors numbers of forage fish in alaska, the large number of dead murres points to a lack of prey. murres need to track large schools of fish, as they eat as much as 30 percent of their body mass per day.', '\"so when they\\'re gone, no one has any information on them to show that they\\'re gone, except birds are showing us they\\'re gone,\" irons said.', 'water temperatures in 2015 were above average overall, and, prior to the die-off, murres were found in uncommon areas. in addition, many females were too weak to breed last year, according to kathy kuletz, a biologist for the us fish and wildlife service. \"the length of time we\\'ve been seeing dead birds, and the geographic scope, is much greater than before in other die-off events,\" said kuletz. \"we\\'re looking at many times that. so possibly a good chunk of the population.\"', 'the approximately 2.8 million common murres in alaska are part of a population of as many as 20 million of the birds worldwide, ap reported.', '[large die-offs of this species linked to strong \"el nino\" events have been reported in the past. in 1993, after a prolonged series of high temperature anomalies in the tropical pacific, thousands of murres were found dead with signs of emaciation in the gulf

death occurs within a few days. in horses, glanders generally takes a more chronic course, and horses may survive for several years. chronic and subclinical 'occult' cases are dangerous sources of infection due to the permanent or intermittent shedding of bacteria.\", \"in horses, inflammatory pustules and ulcers develop in the nasal conchae and nasal septae, which give rise to a sticky yellow discharge, accompanied by enlarged firm submaxillary lymph nodes. stellate scarring follows upon healing of the ulcers. the formation of reddish nodular abscesses with a central grey necrotic zone in the lungs is accompanied by progressive debility, febrile episodes, coughing and dyspnoea. diarrhoea and polyuria can also occur. in the skin form ('farcy'), the lymphatics are enlarged and 0.5-2.5 cm sized nodular abscesses ('buds') develop, which ulcerate and discharge yellow oily pus. dry ulcers may also develop. pyogranulomatous nodules are sometimes found in the liver and spleen. discharges from the respiratory tract and skin are infective, and transmission between animals, which is facilitated by close contact, inhalation, ingestion of contaminated material (e.g., from infected feed and water troughs), or by inoculation (e.g., via a harness) is common. the incubation period can range from a few days to many months.\", 'glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected/contaminated material. in the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95 percent within 3 weeks. however, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. a chronic form with abscessation can occur. when handling suspect or known infected animals or fomites, stringent precautions must be taken to prevent self-infection or transmission of the bacterium. laboratory samples must be securely packaged, kept cool (not frozen) and shipped, as outlined in chapter 1.1.2 \"transport of specimens of animal origin\" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/home/eng/health_standards/tahm/1.01.02_transport%20.pdf. all manipulations with potentially infected/contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis (see chapter 1.1.3 \"biosafety and biosecurity in the veterinary microbiology laboratory and animal facilities\" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/home/eng/health_standards/tahm/1.01.03_biosafety.pdf).', 'glanders has been eradicated from many countries by statutory testing, culling of infected animals, and import restrictions. it persists in numerous asian, african and south american countries and can be considered a reemerging disease. glanders can be introduced into glanders-free areas by pet or

2012, had also been a casual contact of elephant a. upon receiving notification for routine annual tb screening from the zoo, patient a had sought guidance from the health department regarding documentation of tb status. patient a had worked at the zoo intermittently during 2012, but had limited contact with elephants (1 hour cumulative presence in the elephant barn). given the pleural (sputum-culture-negative) nature of patient a's disease, patient a was most likely noninfectious.\", \"the oregon health authority had reviewed patient a's _m. tuberculosis_ isolate's genotype in 2012, and found no matches in oregon. when patient a's zoo work history was revealed in october 2013, well into the contact investigation for elephant a, the oregon health authority reviewed the genotypes of the isolates of patient a and elephant a, and found that they differed by only 1 locus in the 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (miru) pattern (figure 2). isolates from patient a and elephant a were analyzed at cdc using whole genome sequencing. comparison of the assembled genomes from the 2 isolates identified no differences. although this result is consistent with transmission, it does not indicate direction of transmission, and does not provide information about how patient a or the elephant contracted tb. elephant b's isolate was genotyped, and spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotype) from this isolate matched those of patient a and elephant a (figure 2).\", \"in may 2014, a 3rd bull elephant, elephant c, aged 44 years, was found to be infected with _m. tuberculosis_ by a positive culture from a trunk washing sample. elephant c's isolate was not whole genome sequenced; all of this elephant's human contacts were the same as those of elephant b. none of the 3 elephants had shown signs of illness, although elephant b had experienced temporary weight loss. all 3 elephants' isolates were susceptible to 1st-line _m. tuberculosis_ drugs. each bull has received different and changing regimens; treatment is ongoing and guided by drug levels and tolerance.\", \"because the strain isolated from patient a matched that from elephant a, mchd personnel searched for an unidentified, common human source and explored the possibility that the elephants might have been previously transmitting tb despite negative trunk washings. during the summer of 2014, the investigation was expanded to include 2 additional groups: 1) all current and former employees who had worked at the zoo since 1 jan 2010, and who met the definition of close contacts, and 2) persons who participated in the same february 2012 zoo orientation as patient a, which was the time when patient a had the most contact with elephants (figure 1, figure 3). among the 28 persons who participated in the 2012 zoo orientation (including patient a), 18 had a negative tst; 9 persons no longer worked at the zoo and could not be reached. mchd concluded that persons who participated in the same orientation as patient a were likely not infected with tb in the course of their orientation. mchd uncovered no evidence of a previously unidentified human case in the zoo orientation cohort who could have infected other humans or elephant a during this time. as of april 2015, reports from cdc's tb genotyping information management system revealed that the isolates from elephant a and from patient a have unique genotypes (spoligotype plus 24-locus miru), not matched locally or nationally.\", \"final results of the investigation of all 31 close contacts since 2010 identified 1 additional positive tst result from july 2011 (induration = 19 mm); this is close to the zoo's baseline of 0-1 conversions per year (figure 1). on the basis of these findings, shedding of _m. tuberculosis_ by elephants before elephant a's diagnosis was deemed unlikely.\", 'throughout the investigation, mchd worked with the zoo and the oregon health authority to ensure the safety of staff members, animals, and the public. close and prolonged contact, including spending multiple hours indoors with infected elephants, was associated with tb transmission in this investigation. continuing routine protocols for annual tb screening of humans who work with elephants is warranted, as is a heightened screening recommendation for the closest contacts until summer 2016. in addition to other administrative and environmental controls, all current close contacts wear a fit-tested n-95 respirator or higher level of protection when in the elephant barn or in contact with any potentially infectious elephant. close contacts will continue to receive a tst every 6 months until summer 2016, at which point the exposure control plan will be reevaluated. close contacts with previous positive test results will have a periodic tb symptom screen rather than a tst.', \"once all elephants complete treatment for active tb, the oregon health authority, mchd, and the zoo veterinarians will decide whether to modify the exposure control plan. the elephants will continue to be screened at regular intervals according to department of agriculture guidelines (2). because of the absence of guidance on determining when an elephant is no longer infectious, the zoo and state and local public health professionals defined an infectious elephant as an animal that 1) has had _m. tuberculosis_ isolated from a culture of a trunk washing sample, 2) has not received at least 2 months of adequate tb treatment, and 3) has not had at least 3 consecutive negative findings from cultures of monthly trunk washing samples; or that is not responding to treatment, has a worsening serologic picture [serologic tests can be used as indicators of active infection in elephants or to assess an elephant's response to infection and treatment] or might otherwise pose a risk to the herd, zoo personnel, or the public. on the basis of the contact investigation results, mchd has advised that outdoor contact with infectious elephants for under 30 minutes and at a distance of at least 25 feet posed minimal risk for tb transmission.\", 'mchd also worked with zoo veterinarians and the state public health veterinarian to develop guidelines for safe public elephant viewing. although the contact investigation suggested minimal risk, all infectious elephants were removed from general display and public viewing within 100 feet. routine indoor and outdoor public viewing of noninfectious elephants is considered safe.', \"discussion----in north america, approximately 5 percent of captive asian elephants are infected with _m. tuberculosis_, on the basis of positive cultures of trunk washing samples or necropsy results (6). the u.s. department of agriculture's animal and plant health inspection service has developed guidelines for the screening and diagnosis of tb in captive elephants, including annual trunk wash samples for mycobacterial culture (2). however, trunk-wash sample cultures, the standard for diagnosing active tb in elephants, are insensitive, and some cases of tb might be missed. serologic screening is used in some settings to identify elephants with tb infection (7), but is controversial among elephant veterinarians and is subject to false-positive results (7).\", \"although mchd's investigation did not suggest previously unrecognized shedding of _m. tuberculosis_ by the elephants, annual personnel screening is an important component of occupational safety, given the potential risk for tb exposure to staff members as well as the risk to elephants of transmission from humans with undiagnosed tb. organizations that conduct tb testing for employees should have a mechanism for tracking results and investigating when tst conversions are elevated above the annual baseline. in addition, better understanding of modes of tb transmission between humans, elephants, and other animals might lead to more comprehensive guidelines for prevention of tb transmission in high-risk settings (8). genotyping surveillance, in conjunction with epidemiologic investigation, might also be effective in linking human and non-human tb cases and evaluating unrecognized transmission, especially if the strains are rare. collaboration between public health, veterinary medicine, and occupational health experts would allow for better understanding of the risks for and prevention of zoonotic transmission of _m. tuberculosis_.\", '[the mmwr report above is a summary of the epidemiologic investigation of an outbreak of tuberculosis (tb) among

(because the 3 elephant tb isolates were susceptible to 1st-line _m. tuberculosis_ drugs (presumably including pyrazinamide), infection with _mycobacterium bovis_ can be ruled out on this basis, as well as on the basis of spoligotyping results. _m. bovis_ is a member of the _m. tuberculosis_ complex, but is inherently pyrazinamide-resistant.)', \"another person (person a) who had worked at the zoo intermittently during 2012, but had limited contact with elephants was diagnosed with pleural tb in 2012. this zoo worker was thought to be was most likely noninfectious (his sputum-culture was negative), but the genotypes of _m. tuberculosis_ from this person and elephants a and b matched. however, results of tuberculin skin tests in close contacts of the elephants at the zoo since 2010 failed to suggest previously unrecognized shedding of _m. tuberculosis_ by elephants before elephant a's diagnosis in 2013. thus, the source for infection in person a or the elephants remains unknown.\", 'in an excellent summary of tb outbreaks in u.s. elephant facilities that appeared in promed-mail post tuberculosis, elephant - usa (05): (or), background 20140707.2592267, promed-mail

cantonensis_, known as the rat lungworm. while the rat lungworm is considered established in snail populations in hawaii, until now it has not been commonly seen in the continental united states. however, the researchers' findings show the parasite may now be established in south florida, which raises concerns about how it got there and the potential implications for both animal and human health.\", '\"determining the geographic distribution of this parasite in florida is important due to the hazards to human health,\" said heather walden, phd, an assistant professor of parasitology at uf\\'s college of veterinary medicine and lead author of a study published online this month [february 2015] in the journal of parasitology.', \"the rat lungworm is a nematode that can affect both animals and humans. it uses the rat as a definitive host and gastropods, such as snails, as intermediate hosts. florida's large horticultural industry makes the parasite's presence in the state particularly disturbing because plant nurseries are one of its [the parasite's. mod.sh] most important modes of transport.\", '\"most of the snails found to be intermediate hosts for this parasite in our study are invasive and some feed on or shelter on ornamental plants, which have the potential for distribution throughout florida and in other areas of the united states,\" walden said.', \"walden's research builds on a previous uf study, which reported that a 6 year old orangutan treated at uf in 2012 after exhibiting neurological symptoms was infected with the rat lungworm. the animal had a history of eating snails, walden said. in 2013, walden and a colleague visited the miami area to collect terrestrial snails from the orangutan's infection site. they sorted snails by size, shape, and color and identified them by species. the scientists collected mucus from all of the snails and analyzed specimens for the presence of nematodes. in addition, rat fecal samples were collected from the original infection site and examined for nematodes.\", 'of 5 species of terrestrial snails tested, 3 tested positive for the rat lungworm. one species was the same as the orangutan had ingested, one is a known intermediate host, and the other had never previously been identified as an intermediate host, the study states. all of the rat fecal samples contained the nematode.', \"walden is working with study co-author john slapcinsky, an invertebrate zoologist who specializes in the study of mollusks with uf's florida museum of natural history, to properly identify and process all of the snails collected in this project.\", 'in addition to the danger to humans, the rat lungworm can also affect dogs, horses, and birds. \"these species all get similar diseases,\" walden said. \"so these findings are of interest not only to companion animal medicine but to human medicine as well.\" the parasite causes a rare and potentially fatal form of meningitis in people, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.', 'walden hopes to broaden her survey to the entire state of florida and will be working with uf veterinary students in the endeavor. \"humans can\\'t become infected with this parasite unless they eat an undercooked or raw snail,\" she said. \"some animal species can harbor the infective larvae, like different crustaceans or frogs. as long as food is cooked and you wash your produce, you will most likely never ingest it.\" as for pet owners, \"i often tell my students, \\'don\\'t let your pets eat lizards or catch mice,\\' to avoid potential infection of other parasites. snails also fall into that group,\" walden said. \"if you know you have a snail problem, try to keep your pet away from that area.\"', 'the abstract

causative agent for 2 non-human primate deaths in florida, one attributed to ingestion of _zachrysia provisoria_. our study further supports the presence of _a. cantonensis_ in _z. provisoria_ in

\"bitey\" when being handled. the 2nd bat was found in a local church on 10 jan 2014, captured in a container and taken to the same rehabilitation facility. this male bat had crusting lesions on his chin.', 'the bats were housed individually under conditions that would induce normal torpor or hibernation but they were reluctant to drink and had lost weight. there was difficulty regulating the temperature of the hibernation chamber, with the temperature dropping below 4 deg c [39.2 deg f] rather than maintaining the desired temperature range of 6-9 deg c [42.8-48.2 deg f]. the bats subsequently died within 2 days of each other (the female on 16 feb 2014 and the male on 18 feb 2014) and were submitted for autopsy the following day. on examination of brain tissues under light microscopy characteristic rabies virus inclusion bodies, so called negri bodies, were observed and immunohistochemical stains, specific for rabies, confirmed the diagnosis. as there was no history of direct human contact, samples were not sent to the canadian food inspection agency (cfia) rabies lab until after the diagnosis was made by cwhc.', 'these cases are interesting for several reasons. first, it highlights the importance of bats as a source of rabies in canada, and elsewhere, and the potential of bats to come into contact with humans. big brown bats often hibernate in buildings and for that reason are found frequently by members of the public. live bats are commonly taken to rehabilitation facilities due to public education campaigns stressing the importance of these often maligned animals. fortunately this rehabilitation facility had taken precautions to prevent human exposure. we have had similar situations in the past where bats have tested positive while being rehabilitated and precautions had not been taken which resulted in post-exposure treatment of people and considerable anxiety for those involved. these 2 cases are also interesting because of the long incubation period observed in these bats, assuming they were suffering from rabies at the time they were submitted to the rehabilitation centre and they did not have contact with each other.', 'finally these cases are also noteworthy as it highlights the changing role of the federal canadian food inspection agency (cfia) in rabies diagnosis and surveillance. the cfia will only test animals for rabies when there is a human health risk but will confirm the diagnosis of positive tests from non-human health risk cases done in other laboratories. the canadian wildlife health cooperative, and other similar agencies, have now taken on primary responsibility for diagnosis and surveillance of rabies in wildlife. appropriate precautions should always be taken when handling bats in order to prevent exposure to rabies and other diseases.', 'genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the new world. bats from most of the estimated 41 bat species in the united states, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. these data suggest that rabies viruses are maintained in animal populations predominantly through intraspecific transmission. that is, transmission rarely occurs between species, such as when a rabid bat infects

lead can be. unborn children are the most vulnerable.', 'exposure to even low levels of lead can cause damage over time, especially in children. the greatest risk is to brain development, where irreversible damage may occur. higher levels can damage the kidneys and nervous system in both children and adults. very high lead levels may cause seizures, unconsciousness, and possibly death.', 'people with higher lead levels have a greater risk of long-lasting health problems. they must be followed carefully. their nerves and muscles can be greatly affected and may no longer function as well as they should. other body systems may be harmed to various degrees, such as the kidneys and blood vessels. people who survive toxic lead levels may have some permanent brain damage. children are more vulnerable to serious long-term problems.', 'doctors usually use a simple blood test to detect lead poisoning. a small blood sample is taken from a finger prick or from a vein. lead levels in the blood are measured in micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dl). a level of 5 mcg/dl or higher indicates your child may have unsafe levels of lead in their blood and should have their blood tested periodically. if levels become too high -- generally 45 mcg/dl or higher -- your child should be treated.', \"the 1st step in treating all degrees of lead poisoning is to remove the source of the contamination. if you can't remove lead from your environment, you may at least be able to reduce the likelihood that it will cause problems. for instance, sometimes it's better to seal in rather than remove old lead paint. your local health department can recommend ways to identify and reduce lead in your home and community.\", 'for children and adults with relatively low lead levels, simply avoiding exposure to lead may be enough to reduce blood lead levels.', \"for more severe cases, your doctor may recommend:- chelation therapy. in this treatment, you take a medication that binds with the lead so that it's excreted in your urine.- edta therapy. doctors treat adults with lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dl of blood with one or more of 3 drugs, most commonly a chemical called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta, or edetic acid). depending on your lead level, you may need more than one treatment. in such severe cases, however, it may not be possible to reverse damage that

transmitted through kissing or sharing drinking utensils. hsv-1 can also cause genital herpes, although hsv-2 is the main cause of genital herpes. hsv-2 is spread through sexual contact. you may be infected with hsv-1 or hsv-2 but not show any symptoms. often symptoms are triggered by exposure to the sun, fever, menstruation, emotional stress, a weakened immune system, or an illness.', 'there is no cure for herpes, and once you have it, it is likely to come back. however, some people may have one outbreak and then never have another one. in between herpes outbreaks, the virus lies dormant (as if it is hibernating or sleeping) in nerve cells. exposure to hsv-1 is extremely common -- as many as 90 per cent of american adults have been exposed to the virus.', 'while most herpes infections do not cause serious complications, infections in infants and in people with weakened immune systems or herpes infections that affect the eyes can be life threatening. further information would be welcomed. - mod.cp', 'the above news report describes an outbreak of painful, bleeding sores and scabs on the faces of indigenous mexican children (age not specified) that in some children spread over the entire body and that have interfered with eating, laughing, running, or sleeping. the news report says that the sores have been attributed to herpes (presumably herpes simplex) virus (hsv) infection, but fails to say how this diagnosis was made.', 'hsv causes several different syndromes. hsv infection most commonly causes clusters of inflamed, small, painful blisters on the skin that eventually break open. in children and adults, hsv can cause sores around the mouth or face (orofacial herpes); sores on the genitals (genital herpes); or on the hands (herpetic whitlow). initial orofacial herpes may be more severe -- involving the oral mucosa and gingiva (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis) -- than recurrent infection, which causes small blisters mainly on the lips (herpes labialis). in the newborn, contact with infected maternal genital secretions at the time of delivery may cause: 1) skin, eye and mouth disease; 2) encephalitis; or 3) disseminated infection (multiple organ system involvement, including lung, liver, adrenal glands, eye, and the brain, sepsis, as well as disseminated cutaneous lesions). in immunocompromised individuals, hsv can also cause multiple organ and cutaneous dissemination.', 'multiple hsv skin infections also can occur in immunocompetent individuals as a result of skin-to-skin contact with hsv-infected sites on another individual or autoinoculation (self-infection). cutaneous or ocular infection (keratitis, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis) that occurs among athletes involved in contact sports is called herpes gladiatorum. the infection is often accompanied by lymphadenopathy (enlargement of the lymph nodes), fever, sore throat, and headache. one of the largest outbreaks of herpes gladiatorum occurred in 60 of 175 high

wednesday [21 aug 2013] that bats in saudi arabia were the source of the mysterious virus that has sickened 96 people in the middle east, killing 47 of them.', 'the outbreak of middle east respiratory syndrome, or mers, has been going on for 15 months, with most victims falling ill in saudi arabia and others growing sick after having traveled to the middle east. in a study released wednesday [21 aug 2013], an international team of doctors blamed coronavirus in bats for the human outbreak, but said that many questions remained, in part because a perfect match for the virus was found in only a single insect-eating bat out of about 100 saudi bats tested. and since such bats do not normally bite people, drool on fruit or do other things that might transmit the disease to people, it was still unclear how the virus leapt to humans.', 'the bat is a _taphozous perforatus_, or egyptian tomb bat, which roosts in abandoned buildings, and the virus was found in a fecal sample.', 'so it is possible, said dr jonathan h epstein, a veterinarian with the ecohealth alliance who helped trap the bats, that victims, like shepherds who might seek shelter in the buildings, picked it up by breathing in dried bat guano -- similar to the way that americans have been infected with hantavirus while sweeping up dried mouse droppings.', 'but it is also possible that an animal picked it up that way and then infected a human. pigs, for instance, can get nipah virus from bats and then pass it to humans in slaughterhouses.', 'further tests on camels, sheep, goats, and a cow will be finished soon, said dr w ian lipkin, head of columbia university\\'s center for infection and immunity, which has already done 15 000 polymerase chain reaction tests tracking the virus. \"it\\'s a huge amount of work,\" he said.', 'it has been known for several months that bats in africa and eastern europe carried viruses related to mers, but the relevant virus had not been found in middle eastern bats before. camels in oman have shown antibodies to a similar virus.', 'knowing that one bat had an identical virus is a start, but more testing will be needed, said dr ziad a memish, the saudi deputy health minister who was a co-author on the study and gave a presentation on the virus in washington on wednesday [21 aug 2013].', 'the infected bat was in an abandoned house in a date palm orchard in bisha, a small saudi arabian city. investigators from columbia and ecohealth alliance took samples there because the 1st known victim of the mers outbreak was a businessman who had lived in bisha and had his business, a large paint warehouse, nearby. the warehouse had a large garden with fruit trees and insects that attract many kinds of bats. the victim, a wealthy 60-year-old man, got sick in mid-june [2012] and died 2 weeks later, dr lipkin said.', 'the victim also owned 4 pet camels that were sampled, but those results are not in yet, dr lipkin added. samples taken from livestock in countries with endemic foot-and-mouth disease must first be delivered to an agriculture department laboratory on plum island, massachusetts, to be certified negative for foot-and-mouth before they can be released for further testing.', \"those restrictions can add months to the testing process, dr memish said. that is one reason the bat samples were tested sooner, although other problems emerged: 1 of 2 frozen shipments of bat samples -- the one the positive bat was in -- was opened at customs on entry into the united states and had thawed out by the time it reached dr lipkin's lab 48 hours later.\", 'what was recovered from that sample, however, was a 100 percent match, which is virtually unheard of in virology, the study said.', 'the victim from bisha had separate houses for his 3 wives and was building a 4th for a woman he planned to marry, \"which suggests he was still vigorous,\" dr lipkin said.', \"but most of those killed by the new virus were old and had chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease. cases are being found of younger, healthier victims who often have milder symptoms, according to dr memish, so it may soon be established that the disease's mortality rate is much lower than 60 percent.\", \"in his presentation wednesday [21 aug 2013], hosted in washington by the university of pittsburgh medical center's center for health security, dr memish said he only learned of the existence of the new virus in his own country when he read about it late last september [2013] on promed, an outbreak-alert service.\", 'dr memish said that by then, it was too late to advise travelers not to come to the annual pilgrimage to mecca, which draws 4.5 million pilgrims. \"that put an incredible strain on our system,\" he said.', 'his department ordered all saudi hospitals to look for and report unusual cases of pneumonia. the virus does not spread easily from person to person, but there have been case clusters in which family members or nurses and doctors who cared for patients were infected.', 'this year [2013], the kingdom has suggested that older people, very young children, and those in ill health or with suppressed immune systems not make the pilgrimage.', 'middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) adds to the extensive list of deadly viruses transmitted by bats. bats are reservoirs for rabies, _filoviridae_ viruses such as ebola and marburg, and _paramyxoviridae_ viruses such as hendra and nipah. another coronavirus with a bat reservoir, sars-cov, caused great worldwide alarm a decade ago. sars-cov originated from chinese horseshoe bats (fam. _rhinolophidae_) and evolved to a form that could be transmitted from human to human (airborne transmission), thus spreading quickly from china and generating widespread panic in 2002 and 2003. this pathogen caused 774 deaths and more than 8000 cases of illness. bats were the carriers of this virus, but it is probably only passed to humans through intermediate hosts (the 1st animal host discovered was a civet in a live animal market).', 'so far, mers-cov has been transmitted human-to-human only in a few instances. the evolution of this virus must be tracked closely to anticipate and timely identify the emergence of novel lineages more capable of human-to-human transmission.', \"[the following excerpts from the 'ahead of print' paper

case-patient in bisha and collected samples from bats less than 12 km from his home, in an abandoned date palm orchard, and less than 1 km from his place of employment, a hardware store that fronted a garden and date palm orchard. although neither family members nor employees recalled seeing bats, the team observed roosting bats and guano in abandoned wells and ruins within 12 km [7.5 mi] of his home and insectivorous bats at dusk in the garden behind his store. over 3 weeks, 96 bats representing 7 species [for details, refer to the original text] were captured in mist nets and harp traps, then released after visual speciation and collection of morphometric measurements; wing punch biopsy samples; blood; throat swab samples; and rectal swab samples or fecal pellets. samples were collected into viral transport medium or lysis buffer.', '\"cov sequences were amplified from 220 of 732 roost feces samples and 7 of 91 rectal swab samples or fecal pellets. a product obtained by pcr

africana_) during the dry season in a kalahari-sand habitat in hwange national park, zimbabwe, to investigate the role of geophagy as a mechanism for supplementing low na+ [sodium] levels in browse

investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-[sodium] loss. female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. we found the following consistent with the [sodium]-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, [sodium] in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high [sodium] content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal [sodium]; and 4) elephants in non-kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their [sodium] requirements from ubiquitous [sodium]-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in kalahari-sand habitats.\"', '\"soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (fetio3), hematite (fe2o3), bauxite [alo.oh/al(oh)3], and pyrite (fes2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites, and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides. depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulomb interaction. cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations.\"', '\"with bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. it is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in hwange\\'s kalahari sands habitats. however, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. the rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.', '\"while some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. however, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. this would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done.\"', \"additional information is available from young and jordan's

infects animals through plants or water they consume and has caused periodic outbreaks throughout history.', \"humans can similarly become ill by breathing, drinking, eating or coming into contact with the bacteria's spores through an open cut, often developing blisters with a telltale black centre. if complications like fever, vomiting and bloody diarrhoea aren't treated with antibiotics in time, they can lead to death.\", 'warming has already been tied to the 1st outbreak of anthrax in the arctic region of yamal in 70 years. amid temperatures of up to 35 deg c (95 deg f) in 2016, an estimated 2000 reindeer died and 96 people were hospitalised. a 12-year-old boy died from eating raw venison, as is the local custom, that was infected. experts on the ground concluded that the \"appearance of anthrax was stimulated by the activation of \\'old\\' infection sites following anomalously high air temperature and the thawing of the sites to a depth beyond normal levels.\" anthrax spores can lie dormant underground until temperatures warm to 15 deg c (59 deg f), creating conditions for their reproduction.', 'in previous centuries, residents of the far north did not want to waste scarce firewood burning carcasses and instead interred them in thousands of mass \"cattle graves\" scraped into the hard permafrost. nomadic herders simply left reindeer were they fell and thereafter avoided these \"cursed fields.\" today, the locations of cattle graves are kept secret since they are closed to the public. \"why increase the phobia about these animal burial grounds?\" mr. kershengolts explained.', 'but more than one-third of the 13 885 cattle burial grounds in russia did not meet sanitary norms, according to a state report in 2009.', 'as permafrost thaws, water flows through it more easily, carrying away spores to potentially infect new victims. when anthrax expert vasily seliverstov arrived to respond to the yamal outbreak, he encountered scatterings of dead reindeer lying \"in a chain\" along several miles of the afflicted herd\\'s migration route. he blames that summer\\'s drought. while precipitation is on the rise elsewhere, it\\'s actually decreasing in the northernmost tundra zone.', 'anthrax spores were washed into the silt of one of the small lakes that dot the swampy tundra, mr. seliverstov believes. when the water dried up, hungry reindeer may have come to graze on the anthrax-infected grass that grew in its place. \"in the cursed fields, with all these lakes, the probability of animals being infected is pretty high during a dry summer,\" he said.', 'the threat of anthrax spreading from cattle graves must also be better monitored, he added.', 'yakutia has more such sites than any other region. a 2011 study found there had been more anthrax outbreaks in districts where warming was the greatest, killing 21 people between 1949 and 1996.', 'other diseases could be waiting as well. researchers found smallpox dna fragments on bodies in the russian permafrost and rna from the 1918 spanish flu in alaska.', 'some even fear that those involved in yakutia\\'s woolly mammoth tusk trade could pick up \"paleo-pathogens\" -- prehistoric diseases that humans may have never encountered -- after live bacteria were found in mammoth remains frozen for 20 000 years.', 'a 2014 study revived even older viruses from the siberian permafrost, and scientists were able to bring an 8-million-year-old bacterium back to life from antarctic ice.', 'mr. kershengolts fears that disease could spread beyond the far north in light of mysterious craters believed to be caused by the explosion of methane hydrates. these frozen \"methane bombs\" expand massively when they thaw, building up pressure until they erupt, said mikhail grigoryev of the permafrost institute. since methane traps 30 times more energy than carbon dioxide, its widespread release could profoundly speed up climate change. a dozen craters and 7000 small hills probably containing methane hydrate have been discovered in yamal. yakutia is home to craters like the so-called \"gateway to hell,\" which is more than half a mile long.', '\"if the area of these emissions overlaps with the burials of animals or humans who died from diseases in previous centuries, these spores and pathogens could spread over a huge area. it would be a disaster not just for the arctic,\" mr. kershengolts said. \"the catastrophe could exceed chernobyl.\"', \"anthrax is more active in the russian arctic than many of us had realised. it is not unlikely that an infected carcass, whether reindeer or bovine, frozen in the permafrost would allow the prolonged if not indefinite survival of the spores as long as it remained frozen. whether a methane explosion would produce a cloud of spores is unlikely, as the pieces of carcass shrapnel would be so large as to fall quickly and certainly not float away as an aerosol. but it gets the reader's attention. over the next decade, we can expect to read of more anthrax outbreaks in these parts of the russian siberia. - mod.mhj\"]", "qas": [{"question": "what is the disease reported?", "id": "332", "answers":

eat the goby and other deep swimming bait fish.', \"the gobies carrying the botulism e toxin are now infecting the birds that eat them. botulism e carries a neurotoxin that affects the central nervous

species of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that can grow without oxygen), _fusobacterium necrophorum_ and _bacteroides melaninogenicus_. both bacteria are common to the environment in which cattle live, and _fusobacterium_ is present in the rumen and fecal matter of the cattle. in sheep, _f. necrophorum_ first invades the interdigital skin following damage to the skin, and causes interdigital lesions and slight inflammation. the 2nd stage of the disease is marked by the invasion of the foot by the foot rot bacterium _dichelobacter nodosus_, a gram-negative anaerobe. usually, there is an injury to the skin between the hooves that allows the bacteria to infect the animal.', 'another cause of foot rot may be high temperatures or humidity, causing the skin between the hooves to crack and let the bacteria infect the foot. this is one of the reasons foot rot is such a major problem in the summer. foot rot is easily identifiable by its appearance and foul odor. treatment is usually with an antibiotic medication, and preventing injury to the feet is the best way to prevent foot rot.', 'it seems the causative factor in the elk hoof deformity may not be clear. is the recent finding of a

also be up-to-date on all travel vaccinations, and have access to personal protective equipment during their stay.', 'the incidence of ebola virus disease (evd) cases in the democratic republic of the congo continued to increase this week; however, it remained confined to a limited geographical area within north kivu and ituri provinces. this recent trend is likely attributable, in part, to past

observed in previously inaccessible hotspots.', 'as of 16 apr 2019, a total of 1290 confirmed and probable evd cases have been reported, of which 833 died (case fatality rate, 65%). of the 1290 cases with reported age and sex, 56% (725) were female, and 28% (361) were children aged less than 18 years. the number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 89 (7% of total cases), including 32 deaths. to date, a total of 379 evd patients who received care at ebola treatment centres (etcs) have been discharged.', 'the ongoing vaccination efforts have produced some promising results this past week. on 12 apr 2019, who and institut national de recherche biomedicale (inrb) published a preliminary analysis concerning the efficacy of the rvsv-zebov-gp vaccine currently utilised in this outbreak (please see full report here: https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-ring-vaccination-results-12-april-2019.pdf?ua=1). the data suggested the vaccine demonstrated notable efficacy in preventing ebola infections in vaccinated individuals compared with those who are unvaccinated. between 2-4 apr 2019, the strategic advisory group of experts (sage) convened a meeting to review the epidemiological data and offer further recommendations to the ongoing vaccination efforts. they urged the further expansion of those eligible for vaccination to include children older than 6 months and lactating women -- 2 populations observed to have especially high attack rates and high case fatality rates (please see

evolving the existing vaccination strategy on the ground. along with intensifying contact tracing of cases and vaccinating their known immediate contacts, a greater emphasis is being placed on following up contacts of contacts and ensuring these at-risk individuals are adequately vaccinated against ebola. various approaches are being used at this time to vaccinate people at-risk, including:', '- site-by-site vaccinations at the places of residence and other locations previously visited by cases- simultaneous vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers (hcw/flw) and others at increased risk working in healthcare facilities- pop-up vaccination, where those at risk are invited to an agreed-upon location, outside their place of residence- targeted geographic vaccination of villages if contacts, and contacts of contacts, cannot be clearly ascertained due to security constraints, but are invited to a previously agreed-upon site to be vaccinated.', 'through these strategies, 23 operational vaccination teams have effectively closed previously observed gaps in the vaccination rings surrounding reported cases; rings are currently pending for 10 of the 257 cases confirmed during the period between 28 mar and 6 apr 2019. as of 16 apr 2019, a total of 102 501 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated, of whom 29 720 were hcws/flws. outside of the democratic republic of the congo, vaccination of hcws/flws commenced in neighbouring rwanda on 16 apr 2019, with 176 hcws/flws already vaccinated. it is expected that the vaccination strategy will be an effective means to slowing the spread of evd.', \"infection prevention and control (ipc) efforts have also yielded some notable progress this past week. a revised ipc strategy with an operational work plan for february to may 2019 period has been endorsed by the ministry of health (moh). the strategy and work plan are intended to guide the national coordination activities of the ebola response's ipc task force, and the implementation of activities by the ipc commissions and partners at the subnational level. to support this operational shift, risk communication and community engagement research initiatives are being developed to better understand transmission pathways that can be addressed by the ipc coordination activities. additional support will be provided by collecting feedback through community dialogue on how ipc can be better implemented at the community level.\", 'while the evd outbreak remains ongoing and the rise in number of cases is likely to continue in the following weeks, it should be noted that substantial progress has been made to adapt response strategies to the ever-evolving situation. despite the multitude of challenges posed by having to mount a robust outbreak response in the demanding circumstances in which this evd outbreak is currently taking place, who and partners are continuing to intensify all facets of the response efforts to curtail the further spread of evd in the north kivu and ituri provinces.', 'see source url for more on public health response, who risk assessment and who advice.', 'this is the 4th update of a rapid risk assessment originally produced on 9 aug 2018. this rapid risk assessment addresses the public health risk associated with the current ebola virus outbreak in the drc and its implications for eu/eea citizens. it was triggered by an increase of evd transmission in the affected areas over recent weeks, the persistent occurrence of new cases among contacts unknown at the time of evd diagnosis, the occurrence of a substantial number of cases outside of the ring vaccination contacts and current challenges for the prevention and control of evd.', 'executive summaryas of 10 apr 2019, the ministry of health of the democratic republic of the congo has reported 1206 ebola virus disease (evd) cases, including 1140 confirmed and 66 probable cases, resulting in an overall case fatality of 63%. eighty-seven healthcare workers are among the confirmed cases, including 31 deaths.', 'since mid-march [2019], the weekly number of cases has increased to more than 50, ranging from 52 to 73 cases. viral circulation in the community is persistent, but the epidemiological situation varies among affected health zones. while the majority of the cases have been reported in urban settings, there are cases in rural health zones surrounding urban centres, suggesting transmission ongoing in these areas.', 'despite the impressive mobilisation of evd response actors, significant challenges remain in this complex setting, marked by a long-term humanitarian crisis and an unstable security context. community resistance to ebola response activities, suboptimal infection prevention and control practices in primary healthcare, incomplete contact tracing and follow-up, continuing nosocomial infections, delays in detection and isolation of new cases and community deaths leading to potential exposure of relatives to evd continue to be among the main obstacles.', 'more evd cases are expected in the coming weeks and a wider geographical extension is still possible given the prolonged humanitarian crisis in the region. important cross-border population flows to and from neighbouring provinces and countries and adverse impact of security incidents and persistence of community reluctance and resistance hinders the implementation of evd prevention and control measures.', 'the probability that eu/eea citizens living or travelling in evd-affected areas of the drc will be exposed to the virus is low provided they adhere to recommended precautionary measures.', 'the most likely route of importation of the virus into the eu/eea is through infected travellers from affected areas. since the volume of travellers is small, there are no international airports in the affected areas with direct flights to eu/eea member states and exit screening is in place at goma airport, the risk of evd-infected people arriving in the eu/eea is very low. however, the risk can only be eliminated by stopping transmission at local level.', 'excerpts:- drc reaches 100 000 people vaccinated against ebola in north kivu and ituri.- the significant increase in new cases confirmed in recent weeks, particularly in active households in butembo and katwa, is partly explained by the temporary cessation of vaccination activities in march [2019] following the rise in violence against the teams of the response. because of the problems of violence and safety, 45 vaccination rings

melioidosis. melioidosis is considered endemic to southeast asia and northern australia. however, sporadic cases do occur elsewhere in the world, especially in tropical areas (1). the predominant method of molecular subtyping of _b. pseudomallei_ is multilocus sequence typing (mlst), which is based on a comparison of the alleles of 7 housekeeping genes to generate a sequence type (st) (2). these data can then be analyzed by using tools such as eburst, which is used to infer phylogenetic patterns (3).', 'as of 30 may 2013, a total of 3028 _b. pseudomallei_ isolates were listed in the mlst database (http://www.mlst.net); these isolates are predominantly from southeast asia (1036 isolates) and australia (1776). some entries are from other pacific areas (e.g., new caledonia [9 isolates] and hong kong [39]) and other parts of the world (e.g., africa [8], europe [15], and the western hemisphere [30]) or of unknown origin (32).', 'for a population study, pearson et al. analyzed the sts in the _b. pseudomallei_ mlst database along with other data, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms from whole-genome sequencing data (4). their study indicated some population structures associated with geographic origin, in particular, clades associated with isolates from southeast asia or northern australia. the data were used to support a hypothesis that _b. pseudomallei_ originated on the australian continent, spread to southeast asia, and from there spread throughout the world (4).', 'for an isolate of unknown origin, however, mlst alone may not provide information about geographic origin. for example, isolates from the western hemisphere have yielded sts unique to that hemisphere, but when these isolates were analyzed by eburst or other methods, no distinct clade was found. in the clusters in which these sts appear, sts are intermixed with those from regions in which melioidosis is traditionally endemic, such as southeast asia (2,4). therefore, a method for determining whether an isolate of unknown origin is from the western hemisphere is desirable.', 'recently, ligouri et al. developed a typing scheme by measuring the length polymorphisms in the 16s-23s internal transcribed spacer (its) of _burkholderia_ spp. (5). the typing scheme consists of 10 types: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, ce, ge, and gc. ligouri et al. found that some types are unique to a given _burkholderia_ species (i.e., a = _b. thailandensis_, b = _b. humptydooensis_, d = _b. oklahomensis_, and f = _b. cepacia_). they also determined that type c could be found in _b. mallei_ and in _b. pseudomallei_. the remaining 5 types were exclusive to _b. pseudomallei_ (5). ligouri et al. determined that types c, e, ge, and ce were the predominant types for isolates from northern australia and southeast asia and that type g was rare in australia (4 isolates) and southeast asia (3). they noted, on the basis of a limited number of strains from these regions, that type g was overrepresented in isolates from other parts of the world: madagascar (1 isolate), ecuador (2), puerto rico (2), venezuela (1), and kenya (1). they hypothesized that a genetic bottleneck occurred during the dispersal of type g to regions outside of southeast asia and australia (5).', 'its typing of _b. pseudomallei_ might be a powerful tool for linking cases of melioidosis to regions outside of those in which melioidosis is highly endemic, such as southeast asia and northern australia. to further investigate this trend, we assessed the its types of _b. pseudomallei_ from the western hemisphere.', 'the studyall tested western hemisphere isolates from our collection were its type g (table [for table, see original url. - mod. ll]). in addition to those isolates tested, we performed in silico analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from other _b. pseudomallei_ isolates in our collection or publicly available data with origins in the western hemisphere and found them to also be its type g (table). as expected, eburst analysis of the sts from the type g strains that originated in the western hemisphere did not yield a discrete clade. these sts are interspersed with other sts that are predominantly from southeast asia (figure [for figure, see original url. - mod. ll]). our results support the findings of ligouri et al. (5). the predominance of type g in isolates in our panel of isolates from the western hemisphere is consistent with a hypothesis that these isolates are derived from a bottleneck that occurred during dispersal to the rest of the world from southeast asia.', 'other supporting evidence is provided by testing for the yersinia-like fimbrial (ylf) gene by ylf pcr. the presence of the ylf gene is associated with _b. pseudomallei_ isolates from southeast asia (6). for those strains tested, all were positive for ylf, or the ylf gene was present according to in silico analysis of whole-genome sequencing data when available (table).', 'conclusionsin melioidosis cases for which the origin is unclear, such as for patients with unknown exposure histories or histories of travel to multiple regions to which melioidosis is endemic, its typing along with other molecular epidemiologic tools might be useful for assessing the _b. pseudomallei_ origins. more insight into the relationship of western hemisphere isolates to isolates from regions to which melioidosis is highly endemic might come from whole-genome sequencing. as more isolates are analyzed, such studies might enable higher confidence in the geographic origin of isolates.', '[this just-published emerging infectious diseases article helps characterize isolates of the bacilli of melioidosis. it is interesting that it appears that they all seem to be its g but otherwise were not in the same clade. the clade analysis, as discussed, had previously suggested that _b. pseudomallei_ originated in the northern territory

boy in guinea was infected in december 2013, likely from a fruit bat. q: why do so many ebola survivors experience health problems after they\\'ve recovered?a: according to dr. bausch, \"the dogma prior to this outbreak was that survivors got better after a time. that even though they had been through hell, once they got better that was the end of it -- they were okay. but now we\\'re recognizing that there are a lot of problems that can persist for a long time.\"q: could this kind of resurgence of the virus in a survivor spark a new outbreak?a: as far as researchers can tell, when ebola virus flares up again in a survivor, the person doesn\\'t develop full-blown evd. instead, the virus causes problems in a particular part of their body. the most common seems to be eye infection. and in those cases, the ebola virus is basically trapped inside the eye, so it can\\'t be transmitted to other people.q: what happens when a pregnant woman contracts ebola?a: according to dr. bausch, as far as researchers can tell, even if a pregnant woman who is infected with evd survives, the fetus will not. often the woman will miscarry while she is still sick, but she may not actually lose the fetus until after she recovers. in those cases, the baby is stillborn, and the woman no longer has ebola virus in her blood, but the stillborn child that she delivers will still have the virus in its blood. this presents a risk to health care workers who assist with the delivery. in a few cases, workers are suspected to have been infected under these circumstances.q: did any of those experimental treatments that people were clamoring for during the outbreak - the zmapp drug, the infusions of blood plasma from survivors -- actually work?a: according to dr. bausch, unfortunately no. the drug companies mobilized quickly but \"by the time we were ready to do the trials, the bottom of the outbreak had dropped out and the cases started to fall away. suddenly there were no patients. we haven\\'t come out of this being able to say, \\'this one is great. now we have a treatment for ebola.\"', 'sierra leone ebola sample was in tests as who declared epidemic

and rubella are serious and contagious diseases with serious consequences. however, they can be eliminated by vaccination; however, for vaccination to be effective at a population level, coverage must remain above 80 per cent and coverage in cameroon has been consistently below this level, meaning significant parts of the population are at risk, including infants (too young to be vaccinated). the ifrc is strategizing to get children in the area vaccinated, which includes human resources, security, logistics, and supply chain and communications.', \"measles outbreaks are a sign of bigger problems------------------------------------------ this year [2015] was supposed to mark the point when measles -- one of the most infectious diseases on the planet -- was finally under control. as a step in its plan to eliminate measles worldwide by 2020, the world health organization set a target to reduce the number of cases by 95 percent between 2000 and 2015. the effect has been significant: measles deaths have fallen from more than 700 000 in 2000 to around 115 000 last year [2014]. but for a disease that's easily preventable, 115 000 deaths -- the majority of them children under 5 years old -- is still too high. and as the who reported in november [2015], progress has flat-lined over the past 5 years, and outbreaks are still common.\", 'what, exactly, went wrong?', \"at 1st glance, it seems impossible to pinpoint just one reason for all the various outbreaks around the world. in the nuba mountains of sudan, a key factor is the lack of access to humanitarian aid for people trapped in conflict zones; in west africa, a measles resurgence can be attributed largely to the ebola epidemic's crippling effect on local health systems. and in california, the blame rests squarely on the shoulders of anti-vaccine groups for whipping up unfounded fears about the safety of measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccines.\", \"however, all of these seemingly disparate cases -- and all other measles outbreaks, for that matter -- still have a common underlying cause. whenever measles strikes, it's more than just an outbreak of a single disease, or an indication that children aren't receiving their measles shots; it's also a warning that immunization coverage in general, for all vaccine-preventable diseases, is lower than it should be. to put it another way: when rates of routine vaccination -- children receiving all their shots on schedule, as a preventive measure rather than a reaction to an outbreak -- start to fall, the 1st sign is usually a measles outbreak. in global-health security terms, these outbreaks are the proverbial canaries in the coal mine.\", \"measles is considered such an integral part of the global-health agenda for precisely that reason: its contagious nature makes it a good proxy for assessing immunization levels for all vaccine-preventable diseases. but in light of the who's recent report about global progress towards eliminating measles -- or, perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof -- it's clear the current approach isn't working as well as it should be.\", \"because measles is so infectious compared to other diseases -- so contagious, in fact, it's possible to catch it just by entering a room, hours after an infected person has been there -- a much higher level of immunization coverage is required in order to achieve herd immunity. for many common infectious diseases, herd immunity kicks in when 80 to 85 percent of the population has been immunized. but for measles, an outbreak can occur as soon as coverage drops below 90 percent.\", \"such a high level of contagion means it's futile to attempt to eliminate the disease from each affected region in isolation. at the beginning of the 21st century, health authorities in the western hemisphere came close, reducing the number of cases in the region by 99 percent from where they'd been in 1990 -- but high levels of immunity weren't maintained, and the americas saw new outbreaks a few years later as the virus made its way over from other parts of the world.\", 'in general, though, elimination efforts have generally relied on region-by-region mass measles-vaccination campaigns. these campaigns are often too reactive to be effective over the long term, treating the symptom of a measles outbreak rather than the broader cause: a lack of routine immunizations. while mass vaccination against a single disease is certainly an effective tool in helping health officials respond to outbreaks, it can also draw attention and resources away from more farsighted efforts to increase routine immunization coverage. as a result, it can inadvertently increase the risk of future outbreaks of measles and other infectious diseases.', 'the elimination of measles, then, may depend on a more sweeping, less targeted strategy. in the remaining 5 years until 2020, the year that was supposed to mark the total elimination of measles, the who and other global-health agencies may be more effective if they focus their resources on routine immunizations that boost population immunity against multiple diseases, rather than playing catch-up with just one. as tom frieden, the director of the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) once noted, \"a measles outbreak anywhere is a risk everywhere\" -- and for more reasons than measles alone.']", "qas": [{"question": "what is the disease reported?", "id": "161", "answers": [{"answer_start": 66, "text": "measles update "}]}, {"question": "where was the disease reported?", "id":

we also consider the role mammalian scavengers may play is dispersing prions.', 'abstract--------chronic wasting disease (cwd) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy afflicting the cervidae family in north america, causing neurodegeneration and ultimately death. although there are no reports of natural cross-species transmission of cwd to noncervids, infected deer carcasses pose a potential risk of cwd exposure for other animals. we placed 40 disease-free white-tailed deer (_odocoileus virginianus_) carcasses and 10 gut piles in the cwd-affected area of wisconsin (usa) from september to april in 2003 through 2005. we used photos from remotely operated cameras to characterize scavenger visitation and relative activity. to evaluate factors driving the rate of carcass removal (decomposition), we used kaplan-meier survival analysis and a generalized linear mixed model. we recorded 14 species of scavenging mammals (6 visiting species) and 14 species of scavenging birds (8 visiting species). prominent scavengers included american crows (_corvus brachyrhynchos_), raccoons (_procyon lotor_), and virginia opossums (_didelphis virginiana_). we found no evidence that deer consumed conspecific remains, although they visited gut piles more often than carcasses relative to temporal availability in the environment. domestic dogs, cats, and cows either scavenged or visited carcass sites, which could lead to human exposure to cwd. deer carcasses persisted for 18 days to 101 days depending on the season and year, whereas gut piles lasted for 3 days. habitat did not influence carcass decomposition, but mammalian and avian scavenger activity and higher temperatures were positively associated with faster removal. infected deer carcasses or gut piles can serve as potential sources of cwd prions to a variety of scavengers. in areas where surveillance for cwd exposure is practical, management agencies should consider strategies for testing primary scavengers of deer carcass material.', '--communicated by:sukie crandall<sukie@mac.com>', '[our heartfelt thanks to sukie for these very interesting articles. while fresh faeces are unattractive to grazing

_trichinella_-infected domestic animals, or game. animals become infected by feeding on _trichinella_-infected muscles.', 'ingested infective larvae mature and mate in the small intestine of host species including humans, pigs, rats, bears, walruses, horses (occasionally) and many other flesh-eating mammals, and birds and reptiles. the adult worms survive less than 2 months. the larvae produced migrate and persist in the muscles of their hosts. susceptible new hosts become infected by ingestion of muscle tissue that contains these larvae.', 'tissue digestion and tissue compression methods have been used for the direct detection of _trichinella_ larvae in tissues. _trichinella_ larvae usually localise in preferred muscle sites, particularly in low-level infections, and these sites may vary by host species. it is important that preferred sites be sampled to maximise test sensitivity. for example, in pigs, the diaphragm (crus) and tongue muscles are the 2 most preferred sites, whereas in horses, the tongue harbours the most worms, followed by the masseter, diaphragm and neck muscles.', 'the artificial digestion methods involve enzymatic digestion of individual or pooled muscle tissue samples incorporating mechanical homogenisation or grinding, stirring, and incubation. this is followed by filtration and sedimentation procedures to recover and concentrate any larvae that are released from muscle during digestion. samples processed by these methods are examined under a stereomicroscope for the presence of larvae. digestion tests can detect [less than] 1 larva per gram (lpg) of tissue, but at these low levels of infection, uneven distribution of larvae within tissues is a limiting factor. this is compensated for by testing larger samples per carcass, such as a minimum of 3-5 g for pigs and 5-10 g for horses, game and indicator wildlife species such as foxes. digestion methods are recommended for the inspection of individual carcass of food animals such as pigs, horses and game.', 'the compression method (trichinoscopy) is less sensitive than artificial digestion and is not recommended as a reliable test for inspection of carcasses for either food safety or disease surveillance.', 'serological tests: serological assays are the most common tests used for indirect detection. the sensitivity and specificity of serological methods are mainly dependent upon the type and quality of antigen used. most serological test performance (validation) data are from pigs. false negative serological results may occur 3 weeks or longer after muscle larvae become infective in pigs with light or moderate infections. a low rate of false-positive results has also been reported for serological tests. for surveillance or verification of _trichinella_-free herds or regions, serological methods are acceptable.', 'for the purposes of individual carcass inspection, only direct methods can be recommended. pigs harbouring as few as one larva/100 g of tissue have been detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the specificity of elisa for _trichinella_ infection is directly linked to the type and quality of the antigen employed in the test. secretory antigens collected by short-term (18-20 hours) maintenance of _t. spiralis_ muscle larvae in vitro and synthetic carbohydrate antigens currently provide the most specific and economical source. it is critical that appropriate positive and negative control sera be used to ensure that elisas are performing at a minimum acceptable level of sensitivity and

amplicon obtained (330 bp) was sequenced and compared with reference hev strains, using a neighbor-joining method based on the jukes-cantor model for orf 1 nucleotide sequences of selected hev isolates representing genotypes 1-4. this phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amplicon clustered with hev genotype 3, specifically subgenotype 3a.', 'in a routine visit to the hospital 2 months after being discharged, analysis of a blood sample collected at that time showed that hev rna was undetectable, anti-hev igm was negative and anti-hev igg was positive.', 'background----------in recent years, an increasing number of autochthonous infections with hev have been reported in europe and in united states. most of these autochthonous cases have been caused by hev genotype 3 (hev3) and less frequently by genotype 4. seroprevalence studies also show that hev infection in the population of industrialised countries is higher than previously thought. hev3 infections have been associated with the consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked pork, deer and wild boar and to direct contact with infected swine.', 'autochthonous hev infection is usually subclinical or runs a mild course and is self-limiting, but chronic autochthonous infection has been identified among immunocompromised persons, including organ transplant recipients, patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv).', 'a broad set of symptoms of autochthonous hev disease has been seen as well as increasing recognition of its extra-hepatic manifestations. both acute and chronic hev infections have been reported to be associated with muscular weakness, neurological disorders including polyradiculopathy, gbs, bilateral brachial neuritis, encephalitis or proximal myopathy. although neurological disorders associated with hev3 are rare, some data are emerging in literature. in recent years, a number of gbs cases associated with hev infections have been described. gbs is an acute, acquired, autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves that develops in susceptible individuals after infection and, in rare cases, after vaccination. in about 60 percent of cases, gbs is preceded by an infection, most frequently by _campylobacter jejuni_, but other pathogens, such as viruses from family _herpesviridae_ (cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, epstein-barr virus) or bacterial agents (_haemophilus influenzae_, _mycoplasma pneumoniae_) can be responsible.', \"discussion----------exhaustive tests to detect the agents mostly frequently associated with gbs, other than _campylobacter_, gave negative results in samples from our patient. _campylobacter_ was not tested for because of the patient's symptoms. given the serological results, ebv was not considered likely as the causative agent. detection of both igm anti-hev and hev rna in the patient's serum confirmed acute hepatitis e.\", 'the actual incidence of gbs associated with hev infection is unknown because autochthonous hepatitis e is still underdiagnosed in many industrialised countries. this is in part due to the fact that frequently hev infection is subclinical and because the neurological findings surpass the liver injuries and hepatitis is not suspected. hence, hev infection should be considered in neurological diseases associated with abnormal levels of liver enzymes.', 'since the patient reported no travel history, it seems likely that the hev infection was locally acquired. we consider it most probably resulted from consumption of pork or pork products, as there is a strong tradition of pork consumption among portuguese people and hev3 has been detected in domestic pigs from several farms in portugal.', 'interestingly, the patient was in his late 50s. it is known that middle-aged and elderly men are more vulnerable to severe hev3 infection, which can ultimately lead to hospitalisation and possibly death.', 'to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a neurological disorder associated with an autochthonous hev3 infection in a portuguese patient. considering the gbs-hev cases reported, we recommend that testing for hev should be included

increasing preference for raw milk consumption, as raw milk is associated with several perceived health benefits that are believed to be destroyed upon heating. however, many human pathogens can be isolated from raw cow milk. the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in raw cow milk varies, but their presence has been demonstrated in many surveys, and foodborne infections have been repeatedly reported for _campylobacter_, _salmonella_ spp. and human pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing _escherichia coli_ [vtec]. in industrialized countries, milk-borne and milk product-borne outbreaks represent 2-6 per cent of the bacterial foodborne outbreaks.', '\"the aim of this review is to present scientifically sound data regarding the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw and heated cow milk. both microbiological aspects (such as the prevalence of milk-borne pathogens, pathogen growth inhibition by antimicrobial systems and by lactic acid producing bacteria, probiotic bacteria, etc.) and nutritional or health aspects (nutritional value, immunity, allergies, lactose intolerance, diabetes, milk digestibility, etc.) are considered.', '\"as such, it is demonstrated that consumption of raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. it is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. with the exception of an altered organoleptic profile [taste], heating (in particular ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.', '\"introduction------------\"the consumption of raw milk is not well-documented, but in the context of the current trend toward \\'consuming natural\\' and \\'purchasing locally,\\' raw milk consumption is becoming more popular. this is nourished by the perception that heating destroys the nutritional and health benefits of milk, and can even induce some detrimental effects. however, due to its high nutritional value together with the neutral ph and high water activity [content?], raw milk serves as an excellent growth medium for different micro-organisms, whose multiplication depends mainly on temperature and on competing microorganisms and their metabolic products. in order to guarantee its microbial safety and to prolong its shelf-life, milk is heat treated.', '\"the impact of milk pasteurization on public health can be clearly illustrated by means of historical data. before 1938, an estimated 25 per cent of all foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks in the usa were associated with milk, whereas nowadays, the percentage of such outbreaks associated with milk is estimated to be below one per cent. between 1880 and 1907, 29 milkborne outbreaks were reported on average each year in the usa. with the adoption of pasteurization in 1938, milkborne diseases dropped to only 46 outbreaks during the 19-year period from 1973 to 1992, corresponding to an average of 2.4 outbreaks each year. a recent report of the usa cdc indicates that the vast majority of milkborne outbreaks in the usa are in states that permit the sale of raw milk. in england and wales, the great majority of milkborne outbreaks during the 1980s were attributed to the consumption of raw milk. in scotland, a similar situation existed until the sale of unpasteurized milk was prohibited in 1983, which led to a significant drop of the incidence of diseases related to liquid milk consumption.', '\"in the mid-20th century, the main illnesses associated with raw milk consumption were brucellosis and tuberculosis. these have been eradicated as milkborne diseases in developed countries, mainly through herd certification programs which included culling of infected animals, the installation of refrigerated bulk tanks for milk collection on farms, and the introduction of pasteurization. in the past, pasteurization conditions were standardized based on the destruction of _mycobacterium bovis_, a relatively heat-resistant non-sporogenic bacterium that formerly was among the most serious pathogenic bacteria present in milk. pasteurization standards today are based upon the destruction of _coxiella burnetii_, the most heat-resistant milkborne zoonotic pathogen known. in the past 30 years, several previously unrecognized foodborne bacterial infections, including infection with _campylobacter jejuni_, _listeria monocytogenes_, and _escherichia coli_ strain o157 (or more general verocytotoxin-producing pathogenic _e. coli_ [vtec]), have emerged as significant causes of human morbidity and mortality. pathogens mainly present in raw milk today are, among others, _c. jejuni_, _salmonella_ spp., _staphylococcus aureus_, _listeria monocytogenes_, pathogenic _e. coli_ and _yersinia enterocolitica_.', '\"in europe, the current regulatory microbial criteria for raw cow milk are less than or equal to 100 000 colony forming units (cfu)/ml for plate count (at 30 c / 86 f) and less than or equal to 400 000 cfu/ml for somatic cells, as is stipulated in regulation (ec) 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs. in this regulation, health requirements for production animals and hygienic requirements on milk production holdings (such as regarding premises and equipment, hygiene during milking, collection, and transport, staff hygiene) are established as well. in general, raw milk intended for human consumption must meet the requirements of the general food law (regulation (ec) 178/2002) and be free of pathogens. even though improvements in hygiene resulted in routine production of raw cow milk with less than 20 000 cfu (total flora)/ml), this does not guarantee raw milk to be free of pathogens. in approximately 1-6 per cent of the human outbreaks reported in developed countries, milk has been identified as the vehicle of infection. an overview of foodborne disease reports from different industrialized countries indicates that milk and milk products are implicated in 1-5 per cent of the total bacterial foodborne outbreaks, with 39.1 per cent attributed to milk, 53.1 per cent to cheese, and 7.8 per cent to other milk products.', '\"whereas milk quality and safety has been the topic of many research studies, raw milk still continues to be an issue for debate, which is primarily held on the internet where often non-scientifically based information circulates. therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the risks and benefits related to the consumption of raw cow milk at one hand, and to evaluate the effect of heat treatments of milk on these risks and benefits on the other hand, considering the microbiological as well as the nutritional (health) aspects.', '\"conclusions-----------\"in this evaluation it is clearly demonstrated that the consumption of raw milk poses a realistic and unnecessary health threat because of its possible contamination with pathogenic bacteria. it is therefore recommended to heat [raw] milk before consumption, especially when served to young children, pregnant women, or any person suffering from a chronic disease or a suppressed immune system. in this context the attention is drawn to raw milk provided on farms to the general public (such as during a school visit) and raw milk distributors allowing the automatic supply of raw milk from a bulk reservoir to the consumer.', '\"historical data show that the pasteurization of milk has led to improved public health, and more recent data on occasional raw milk consumption indicate the hazard of bacterial infections, which could be avoided by a heat treatment. at present, thermal treatment remains the most frequently used and most effective method to increase the microbiological safety of milk without substantially changing the nutritional value of milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption. table 4 [see original url above] summarizes the main (claimed) benefits of raw milk consumption and the (claimed) detrimental effects of heating discussed in the present paper. almost all arguments put forward by raw milk proponents for not heating milk, can be refuted, and the only substantial disadvantage of heating is the change in the organoleptic profile [taste] of milk. it is clear that this \\'detrimental\\' effect of heating does not countervail the risk posed by raw milk consumption, namely of a milk-borne pathogen infection, which can have serious health consequences.\" - mod.ll']",

total of 6 isolates (5 from austria and one from germany) which had indistinguishable pfge patterns but belonged to different ngs cluster types (figure 1). food consumption histories have been collected from a subset of cases via exploratory interviews by the health authorities since 2013. furthermore, information on food consumption habits are recorded via collection of patients' grocery receipts [2]. many patients can have difficulties recalling food consumption because of their age and their disease. photo documentation of food items regularly purchased by some patients is used for visual support during interviews with other patients. epidemiological studies were conducted in cooperation with regional and local health departments, considering incubation periods published by goulet et al. [3].\", 'regarding the source of the causative food vehicle, the results showed a heterogeneous picture. until now, we have not observed cases with an epidemiological link to an institution (such as hospital infection). preliminary results largely exclude fish and cheese products as a possible source but this has to be complemented by systematic screening of _listeria_ isolates collected from food. based on sequencing results, a pcr protocol aiming to detect ct1248 was developed for screening of isolates and published on the kl website [4].', 'background----------_l. monocytogenes_, the causative agent of listeriosis is mostly caused by the consumption of contaminated food. the majority of infections are mild if they occur in younger, immunocompetent individuals except pregnant women. infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and serious health problems for the newborn. invasive listeriosis can cause severe septicaemia, meningoencephalitis and a wide variety of focal infections. it is usually limited to the elderly and those with compromised immune systems or severe underlying medical conditions. because of the severity of certain clinical manifestations (infections of the central nervous system, septicaemia, and abortion), the high case-fatality rate of up to 30 percent and the long incubation time, human listeriosis is of major public health concern. a recent nationwide case-control study in germany among sporadic disease cases detected cold cooked sausages, packaged cheese and pre-sliced cheese as risk foods [5]. medical conditions associated with listeriosis are immunosuppressive therapy, immunocompromising disease, and gastric acid suppression [5].', 'public health assessment------------------------when considering confirmed as well as possible cases, this is the largest outbreak of listeriosis described in germany to date [6]. considering under-ascertainment, under-reporting, and the considerable proportion of isolates that are not typed, the size of the visible outbreak of invasive listeriosis is certainly underestimated. furthermore, mild and non-invasive gastrointestinal cases, which can make up a significant proportion of disease cases, are not under surveillance in germany. until now, the cluster type ct1248 is confined to this outbreak and investigation via epis did not generate feedback on isolates with a related sequence in participating countries. listeriosis cases have become more frequent over the past years in germany [7] and elsewhere in europe [8]. investigations of listeriosis outbreaks are difficult due to the multitude of possible food vehicles including a broad range of ready-to-eat foods.', 'pfge is suitable for screening but cannot confirm outbreak isolates, whereas ngs appears highly discriminatory and superior for the allocation of cases to the outbreak. the geographical limitation to southern germany and the size of the outbreak area with a population of 27 million inhabitants suggest _listeria_-contaminated food in a supra-regional supermarket grocery chain as the vehicle of infection. although the number of new cases has decreased since august 2015, new outbreak cases are still being reported. we must therefore assume that the source of infection is still active and further cases are possible. further epidemiological studies, laboratory investigations and trace-back of food items are needed and ongoing to narrow down the source of infection.', 'diagnostic laboratories are requested to send any _listeria_ isolates to one of the typing

2-fold.', '1. with the present suits, the hot and humid climate means that doctors and health workers can only spend 30-60 minutes in the suit before getting overheated.', '2. taking off the present suits can be a long and potentially dangerous process, where removing your goggles or hood could lead to ebola exposure to your eyes or nose.', 'usaid recently awarded one of the 1st solutions in a grant competition to a team at johns hopkins that designed a suit, which takes the process of safely removing the suit from 30 minutes to 30 seconds. it is an example where technology and innovation have been rapidly applicable to solving one of the challenges with ebola patient handling.', 'is the ebola crisis a reason to skip rcts [randomized control trials]?----------------------------------------------------------------------in a recent \"perspective\" article in the new england journal of medicine, 3 physicians (drs. cox, borio, and temple) make a strong case for not letting the rush to save ebola patients tempt us to deviate from good science and skip the randomized controlled trial (rct). their arguments cut to the essence of the scientific approach to medicine, and they deserve careful consideration.', 'ebola is the kind of threat that really gets our attention. few cases have even reached the us and europe due to infected travelers and health care workers. we face a risk that ebola may become endemic, smouldering along as a constant presence in africa.', 'there is no known effective treatment.', \"the current approach consists of early identification, isolation, rigorous infection control protocols with space-suit-like personal protective equipment for health care providers, supportive care with intravenous fluids, and conventional treatments for symptoms and complications. the death rate is lower where good medical care is readily available. a number of experimental treatments have been tried or are being considered. several patients have been given serum transfusions from recovered patients to passively supply them with antibodies to the virus. zmapp, a combination of monoclonal antibodies, has been used to treat 7 individuals; some of them recovered, some did not. several anti-viral drugs are under development, and certain selective estrogen receptor molecules and ion channel blockers have also shown promise in vitro. in the face of such a deadly threat, it seems like we can't afford to wait for the results of randomized controlled trials (rcts) published in peer-reviewed journals. some of these experimental treatments might be unsafe and ineffective, but we know ebola is definitely unsafe and deadly. the doctors who gave their critically-ill patients serum transfusions or zmapp did exactly what most of us would have done in the same circumstances. but was it really the best thing to do?\", 'if we give patients zmapp without a control group and some of them recover, how are we to know whether zmapp contributed to their recovery? some have argued that we wouldn\\'t want to deny treatment to a control group, and that we can compare the recovery rate with zmapp to the historical recovery rate without it. that approach is particularly problematic with ebola, since the historical recovery rate is so variable and so dependent on differences in supportive treatment and other confounding factors. as cox, et al. point out, \"the historical case fatality rates are irrelevant if current study patients receive better supportive care.\"', 'allowing patients access to investigational drugs, outside of properly designed randomized controlled trials, can have tragic consequences. using no controls or only historical controls might lead to rejection of treatments that have real but modest benefits, or it might lead to widespread adoption of a treatment that is useless or even harmful. and there are ethical considerations.', 'rcts tend to be slow and cumbersome, but there are ways to streamline the process. advances in trial design can and should be incorporated into ebola rcts. for example, such trials should include ongoing monitoring of results (e.g., group-sequential designs), adaptive elements, and other trial efficiencies to reduce the time required to identify an effective treatment, particularly a very effective treatment. if one investigational drug clearly shows benefit, trials should incorporate it into the new standard of care for all treatment groups thereafter. then a regimen adding a different investigational therapy to the new standard of care could be compared with the new standard of care alone. if multiple investigational drugs are simultaneously available for clinical testing, an rct could include more than one drug and a shared control group. trials could be designed to assess effects on survival (recovery from disease) as the most important and measurable end point.', 'scientists at the national institutes of health [nih], in collaboration with the food and drug administration [fda], the biomedical advanced research and development authority [barda], the department of defense [dod], and clinicians caring for patients with evd [ebola virus disease] in the united states, are leading efforts to develop and implement such trials.', \"it has been argued that patients should have ready access to untested and experimental treatments, and that they have the right to try anything they want, especially when their life is at stake and there is no treatment available that has been tested and proven effective. in some cases, trying an untested treatment might very well help the individual patient; but if the treatment is really effective, providing it outside of controlled trials tends only to slow the progress of science and delay the day when that treatment will be proven effective and added to the armamentarium of conventional medicine so that it can benefit all patients. we need to determine whether a treatment works or doesn't work, and there is only one way to do that: using scientific methodology.\", 'randomized controlled trials are the most reliable way to determine whether any new treatment is safe and effective. it is tempting to bypass them and offer experimental treatments to desperately ill ebola patients outside of a properly designed rct. we would be wise to resist that temptation and to insist on enrolling patients in a proper clinical study. ... -- more', 'new brunswick, new jersey [usa]-based johnson & johnson has begun testing an ebola vaccine in

by severe losses, especially in naive animals. lsd is endemic in many african and asian countries, and it is rapidly spreading throughout the middle east, including turkey. lsd is transmitted by mechanical vectors, but direct/indirect transmission may occur. the disease would mainly be transferred to infection-free areas by transport of infected animals and vectors. in the eu, it could only happen through illegal transport of animals. the risk for that depends on the prevalence in the country of origin and the number of animals illegally moved.', 'based on a model to simulate lsd spread between farms, culling animals with generalised clinical signs seems to be sufficient to contain 90 percent of epidemics around the initial site of incursion, but the remaining 10 percent of simulated epidemics can spread up to 400 km from the site of introduction by 6 months after incursion. whole-herd culling of infected farms substantially reduces the spread of lsd virus, and the more rapidly farms are detected and culled, the greater the magnitude of the reduction.', 'only live attenuated vaccines against lsd are available. homologous vaccines are more effective than sheep pox strain vaccines. the safety of the vaccines should be improved, and the development of vaccines for differentiating between infected and vaccinated animals is recommended. epidemics are not self-limiting when effective vaccination or culling are not applied. active surveillance, rapid detection, and prompt culling of infected herds are effective measures for lsd control. the role of vectors for lsd transmission should be further investigated in both controlled environments and the field. awareness-raising campaigns for farmers and veterinary staff to promote recognition of lsd should be

is a rodent (_mastomys_). the virus is endemic in several west african countries where epidemic outbreaks occur regularly and affect 100 to 300 000 people per year, of which 5 to 6000 succumb. transmission to humans is through contact with food or household products contaminated by the faeces of the reservoir host, inhalation of aerosols of dust contaminated with rodent excreta, or inter-human contact.', 'the clinical picture of lassa fever is variable, from asymptomatic infection, very common (80 percent of cases) to a lightning haemorrhagic fever. the disease begins 6-21 days after the infection with clinical signs including fever, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia. in severe cases, the symptoms worsen, with the appearance of edema, haemorrhagic signs, pericardial and pleural effusions, and more rarely encephalitis. the patient dies in a context of hypotensive and hypovolemic shock and renal and hepatic failure.', 'lassa fever is extremely serious for the pregnant woman, frequently leading to the death of the mother and systematically to that of the fetus.', 'ribavirin (anti-viral drug) has been used successfully in patients with lassa fever.', 'lassa fever is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.', 'world health organization advice--------------------------------the prevention of lassa fever is

when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.', 'on rare occasions, travelers from regions where lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from west africa, especially if they have had exposure in rural areas or hospitals in countries where lassa fever is known to be endemic. healthcare workers who see a patient suspected of having lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice

poisoning.', '\"ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4). gambiertoxins from _gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). the attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 per cent in persons who eat

regional differences in symptom patterns. cfp symptoms associated with eating fish from the pacific ocean are primarily neurologic, and symptoms associated with eating fish from the caribbean sea are more commonly gastrointestinal (4). amberjack often is linked to cfp cases in the caribbean. although the amberjack fish responsible for this cluster of cfp cases tested positive for c-ctx-1, it was not tested for the presence of other ciguatoxins, which also might have been present and could have altered disease presentation (7).', '\"cfp has been associated almost exclusively with eating fish caught in tropical or semitropical waters, but increased global marketing of these species has increased the possibility that persons in temperate zones might become ill with cfp (4). moreover, warming seawaters might expand the ranges of ciguatoxin-contaminated fish (8). in the usa, such fish have been found as far north as the coastal waters of north carolina. despite underreporting, cfp now is considered one of the most common illnesses related to fish consumption in the usa (9).', '\"any level of ciguatoxin 0.1 ppb [parts per billion] or more of fish tissue is thought to pose a health risk (3). as this illness becomes more common in nontropical areas of the world, clinicians need to be aware of its manifestations and how to manage it. although opinions vary on the most effective course of treatment, intravenous mannitol has been a mainstay of management of neurologic symptoms for more than 20 years. early mannitol treatment is considered more effective, but anecdotal evidence suggests that even delayed therapy benefits some patients. amitriptyline also has been useful in relieving some of the neurologic symptoms of cfp (10). if evaluating a possible

the vaccine during the primary sequence (34) or assessing pertussis incidence after the sequence ends at age 5 (35), immunity to pertussis promptly waned. indeed, pertussis incidence and risk ratios rose in the 3 study states (36) at high as 8.8 times and 3.9 times in minnesota between year 1 and year 6 after completion of the sequence. currently 3 antigen and 5 antigen component acellular pertussis vaccines are available in the usa. the 5 component vaccine had greater efficacy in a head-to-head comparison (36). interestingly, the relative risk of pertussis was 8.57 times higher in those with a 5-dose ap schedule as compared to those who had received at least 1 dose of whole cell vaccine (37) while those with 6 doses of ap had a relative risk of 3.55 as compared to the 1 or more whole cell group. whether changing the balance of antigens in the vaccine or adding different antigens is unclear. in a response to the waning immunity observed following the primary immunization sequence of the acellular pertussis vaccine, further immunizations were recommended first for adolescents and then for adults 19-64 years old and then to adults 65 years and older. finally, in order to best \"cocoon\" the as yet unborn baby, recommendations now exist for ap vaccination of the pregnant woman in the 2nd or 3rd trimester (38).', \"evolutional changes have been observed in _b. pertussis_ that may have had a role in the organism's ability to persist in a highly immunized population. despite the genetically monomorphic nature of the pathogen without horizontal acquisition of new genes, mooi and colleagues have observed strains carrying a mutation in the gene for the pertussis toxin gene promoter which mediates increased production that was associated with pertussis resurgence (39) and other genetic differences between surface proteins including pertussis toxin, pertactin, and fimbriae (40). additionally, lan's australian group (41,42) have divided _b. pertussis_ isolates into six clusters based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). the reemergence of pertussis seemed to coincide with the emergence of snp cluster 1 of strains carrying pertactin and pertussis toxin genes (prn2 and ptxp3) able to evade acellular pertussis vaccine-induced selective pressure.\", \"two additional observations have been made following the writing of the piece above:- if pregnant women were not immunized: it is reasonable to immunize them in the immediate postpartum period prior to discharge (1) although this does not optimize the baby's protection since there is

notice the mayonnaise starting to thicken. once it has started to thicken you can pour the oil in a little quicker.- season the mayonnaise with good quality sea salt and add only a tiny pinch at a time. mayonnaise can become too salty very easily.- only use fresh squeezed lemon juice. bottled lemon juice will give your mayonnaise a funny flavor.- use good-quality, free-range eggs, because this condiment is made with raw eggs.\", '\"directions---------1) gather all your ingredients together. i\\'ve found that a sturdy whisk works best and a bowl with high sides will help prevent splashes.2) separate the eggs. save the egg whites for another purpose (like meringue) and place the egg yolks in a small bowl with high sides.3) pour the fresh lemon juice into the bowl with the egg yolks and whisk them well. egg yolks contain a natural emulsifier, lecithin, which helps thicken sauces and bind ingredients.4) slowly, a few drops at a time, pour the oil into the bowl while whisking constantly. once the mayonnaise has started to thicken, pour the oil in a slow and steady stream. if the oil starts to build up at all, stop pouring and whisk the mayonnaise briskly until the oil has incorporated.5) if the mayonnaise starts looking too thick, add enough water to thin it to the consistency you like. add about a teaspoon of water at a time.6) once all the oil has been mixed in, the mayonnaise should be thick and fluffy, with your whisk forming ribbons through the mixture. season it carefully with fine grain sea salt. add a small splash of water if you would like a thinner

after spending 2.5 weeks on intravenous medication in the hospital and an additional 3 weeks in rehabilitation to learn to walk again, he is now at home recovering, albeit slowly.\", 'by now, many people may know to be wary of ticks and use prevention to avoid getting bitten by one since they carry lyme disease. however, many people may not know that 2 other obscure tick-borne diseases, anaplasmosis and babesiosis, are on the rise, causing much worse symptoms than lyme disease.', 'although lyme disease is the most common of all tick-borne infectious diseases in new jersey -- 2589 people were diagnosed in 2014 alone -- anaplasmosis and babesiosis are starting to \"newly emerge,\" said dr. donald allegra, the infectious disease specialist for newton medical center.', 'both are tricky to diagnose. anaplasmosis affects organs in the body and does not show a visible rash where the tick was attached. babesiosis produces malaria-like symptoms in some patients and no symptoms in others.', 'babesiosis disease is caused by microscopic parasites that infect red blood cells, causing patients to come into the emergency room with severe anemia.', 'according to allegra, co-infections are also on the rise where a tick can become infected with 2 diseases from a variety of hosts it feeds on before it attaches to a human, causing the human to develop 2 infections. this can make a person sicker and may take them longer to recover, according to the infectious diseases society of america. \"i don\\'t have specific numbers on cases coming into the er, but i have a strong feeling that (diagnosis of both diseases) is certainly increasing,\" allegra said.', 'a cause for the increase in diagnosis can be due to a multitude of reasons, such as doctors reporting the diseases more often than other years, but allegra believes that the warmer weather may have something to do with it. with a mild fall and an even more mild start to winter -- temperatures have reached record highs for this time of year in sussex county -- people have been spending more time outdoors, hiking and walking their dogs. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, ticks can survive through temperatures that are above freezing.', 'as for the case of the stillwater resident, he was diagnosed with anaplasmosis at newton medical center in late october 2015 after he had just completed blowing leaves outside his house on a mild fall day. the robust man, who chose to remain anonymous, had just completed blowing the leaves off his lawn and went inside his house to take a shower. during his shower, he noticed a tick on his side and his wife promptly removed it. 2 weeks later, he traveled to morristown medical center for a routine appointment to check a large cyst on his kidneys.', 'the appointment concluded that he was in no medical danger from the cyst, which he has had for 5 years. he called his wife on his way home and, according to her, said he was starting to feel ill. as he pulled into the family\\'s driveway, he drove his vehicle into the side of the garage, knocking off his side mirror. immediately making his way to bed, he started to feel worse. \"he had actually, at 1 point, fallen off the bed and was sleeping in an odd spot between the bed and the nightstand,\" his wife said. that\\'s when his wife called a few local neighbors to bring him to newton medical center. doctors found his liver and kidneys to be failing and he was placed on antibiotics.', 'a day later, her husband\\'s illness took a turn for the worse. \"he had a fever of 104 degrees and the doctors had to cover him in ice blankets,\" his wife said. for 4.5 days, her husband\\'s memory was lost and he did not know who anyone was, even his wife. \"i came into the room and he said to me, \\'who are you? i don\\'t know who you are, get my daughter; she just left my room,\\'\" his wife recalled. \"but our daughter wasn\\'t there at all; she lives in north carolina.\" when his condition did not improve and his wife feared she might lose her husband, hospitalist dr. ping liu came in to observe him and, after discussing the tick bite with his wife, ran a series of blood tests.', 'doctors had initially believed that his kidneys were in failure due to a burst cyst -- the one that had just been checked -- but doctors came back with a positive result for anaplasmosis, a disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. according to allegra, anaplasmosis will often cause severe flu-like symptoms, ranging from tiredness to a fever, but a rash is never present. in many cases, anaplasmosis can damage many organs, especially the heart, lungs, kidneys and nerves, according to the national institute of allergy and infectious disease. transmitted through the same black-legged tick as lyme disease, anaplasmosis can be fatal if not treated correctly or not found early enough, even in healthy individuals.', 'her husband, whom she described as incredibly active -- he ran 5 miles a day with the family dog -- was so weak from the disease that he was unable to hold a cup or feed himself. \"he couldn\\'t do anything himself, not even get dressed,\" his wife recalled. eventually, while still in the hospital, he started to lose the feeling in the lower part of his body and was unable to stand or walk. after 17 days on intravenous doxycycline at newton medical center, he was taken to bristol glen nursing home, where he spent the next 21 days in rehabilitation.', 'he spent 46 days away from home while undergoing treatment. the doxycycline eventually started to battle the anaplasmosis and, with physical therapy twice a day, he started to feel better. \"doxycycline is the best treatment for a tick-borne disease, whether it is lyme or anaplasmosis,\" allegra said.', 'the man has been home since 4 dec 2015. a nurse still comes by to take blood and check his organs, especially his kidneys and liver, which are starting to recover, according to his wife. \"things are looking up. although he was a bit confused when he first came home, he is now able to get around with a cane and walk the dog slowly,\" his wife said. his wife is spreading awareness and has handed out information on her husband\\'s illness to more than 20 homeowners on their street. \"i told them there is a new tick on the block and to be careful,\" she said. \"it\\'s important people in sussex county know about this debilitating illness.\"', 'to prevent infection, allegra recommends preventative measures to ensure no contact is made with ticks, including wearing long pants and long socks outdoors. \"ticks like to enter through the legs,\" he said. infection can occur if a tick has been attached for 24-36 hours. if taken within 48 hours of a tick bite, a double dose of doxycycline from your doctor can reduce the risk of getting lyme disease by about half, allegra said.', 'according to the state department of health, 69 cases of anaplasmosis were reported between 29 dec 2013 and 3 jan 2015, with 7 of them in sussex county. babesiosis had a total of 171 cases during that time period, with 5 in sussex county.', '[byline: lori comstock]',

the increases in the number of reported cases.', 'some individuals infected with _a. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. the

are symptomatic with anaplasmosis, illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal. severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, and death.', 'their diagnoses are based on specific antibody tests, detection of specific nucleic acid

ebola and that also pose a threat to americans. it all comes at a time when the united states is making cuts to vital research and development supporting drugs and vaccines for neglected tropical diseases, say advocates.', 'the world spent usd 3.2 billion on research and development for neglected diseases in 2013. that is usd 193 million less than what was spent in 2012, and it is pretty much

services. however, for those who continue to inject, it is extremely important that they seek urgent medical help if they show these early symptoms.\"', 'she added: \"heroin users should avoid injecting heroin into their muscles. injecting heroin into a vein or smoking can reduce the risk of botulism, although not using heroin at all is by far the best course of action.\"', 'the health board said police scotland was aware of the new cases and inquiries were continuing.', '--communicated by:maxwell j.b. murray-smithuniversity of the highlands and islandsscotland, uk<smith.m.j.b@gmail.com>', 'black tar heroin is a type of illegal narcotic derived from morphine. commonly called black tar heroin, heroin content is not actually what distinguishes this particular drug from other kinds of opiates. while black tar does contain an amount of heroin that can range from 29 to 80 percent, the drug is actually identified by the amount of comparatively crude derivatives of morphine that result from incomplete acetylation. without delving into the chemistry too exhaustively, black tar is an unrefined product that is made without the complex equipment and chemicals necessary to produce heroin with a high level of purity. black tar is manufactured primarily in mexico, and is also commonly referred to as black, brown, manteca, night, or dark. it is also produced in smaller quantities in other parts of latin america.', 'black tar has spread throughout north america and can also be found in parts of europe. since the drug does not require the advanced equipment necessary to make pure heroin in white powder form, it is relatively cheap to manufacture and, therefore, cheap to purchase. it is less expensive to buy than white powder heroin, and it is much less expensive than commonly abused prescription opiates such as vicodin or oxycontin.', 'black tar is distinct in appearance from white powder heroin. it ranges in color from black to light brown, and it is sold either as a cola-like chunk, a course powder, or a sticky substance with the consistency of melted tar, hence the name. black tar can be injected in its tar-like form, snorted in its powder form, or smoked. the effects of black tar are similar to the effects of other kinds of opiates, and include feelings of euphoria, relaxation, loss of anxiety, and anesthesia. side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and dry mouth.', 'the most common method of using black tar is injection, and this method poses risks apart from the dangers of the drug itself. for one, black tar users frequently suffer from venous sclerosis, a condition in which the veins shrink and harden. it may become impossible for users to inject intravenously if they develop venous sclerosis, forcing them to resort to subcutaneous injection. however, this method includes its own risks, such as cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. when black tar users inject repeatedly, they put themselves at risk for contracting wound botulism due to the impurities and adulterants present in the drug. the sticky consistency of the drug may also put users at greater risk of hiv if they are washing needles and reusing them.', 'the cheapness of black tar has helped to make it comparatively popular among young users who are inexperienced with drug use. complications from drug use are more common when users are inexperienced. in addition, the impurities present in black tar, as well as the inconsistent ratio of heroin present in the drug, make overdose or death from complications due to the adulterants much more likely. like all derivatives of morphine, black tar is extremely addictive. dependency can occur after very few uses, and tolerance can also increase rapidly, causing users to experience irresistible cravings for increasingly large amounts of the drug.', 'emphasizing the dangers of black tar should not be seen as dismissing or understating the dangers of white powder heroin. while some of the dangers of heroin are increased with black tar, the majority of the risks are present in both drugs. these risks include infectious diseases such as hiv, collapsed veins, heart infections and abscesses, kidney disease, liver disease, depression of the pulmonary system, and pneumonia. furthermore, even supposedly \"pure\" white powder heroin can contain impurities that may lead to serious complications.', 'heroin is equally as addictive as black tar, and both drugs will cause serious and painful withdrawal symptoms if addicted users attempt to stop taking them. these symptoms can range from restlessness and cold flashes to muscle and bone pain, or diarrhea and vomiting. occasionally, symptoms and complications of heroin or black tar withdrawal can lead to death. morphine derivatives such as heroin and black tar are so addictive that cravings can continue for years after users have detoxed. heroin users or users of other opiates often remain at risk for relapse for a significant time after getting clean. - mod.ll']", "qas": [{"question": "what is the disease reported?", "id": "328", "answers": [{"answer_start": 30, "text": "botulism "}]},

suggested there was a background population level of ebola sera positivity, years before the present outbreak. the unknown presence of individuals seropositive for ebola may help explain the observations that some people during the present outbreak, while clearly at risk of ebola, have remained well. for example, is this the explanation of the absence of illness in the household contacts of ted, since 2 of the nurses caring for him became ill, even while using protective clothing, when no such thing occurred in his household, where no illness occurred after follow-up for 21 days?

outbreaks, age, gender, family size, number of multiple cases in a family, among other details is frequently reported, even for a small outbreak. the reporting of this major and widespread outbreak

even though doctors started treating him the same day a stray dog bit him on the face, according to a new report of his case.', '\"it\\'s very rare to have the rabies post-exposure regimen fail, but there are cases where it does fail,\" said dr. amesh adalja, a member of the infectious diseases society of america and a doctor at the university of pittsburgh medical center, who was not involved in the child\\'s care. the vaccine almost always works when the injections are delivered soon after a person is exposed to the rabies virus. it\\'s possible that the doctors failed to completely clean the dog\\'s saliva from all of the boy\\'s wounds. but even without such an error, there are rare instances in which the vaccine does not work in people, according to the case report, published 14 jan. 2015 in the journal bmj case reports.', \"after the dog bite, doctors immediately cleaned and treated the child's wounds, according to the case report. they administered rabies immunoglobulin, which are antibodies that can fight the rabies virus; these were delivered both directly to the bite wound on his forehead as well as intravenously, into his bloodstream. they also injected the post-exposure rabies vaccine into his arm on the day it happened and on days 3, 7 and 14 after the bite, following world health organization guidelines.\", \"but 17 days after the dog bite, the child came to the hospital with fever, vomiting, pink eye and signs of neurological problems, including crossed eyes, agitation, uncoordinated muscle movements and brisk reflexes in his legs. he died that day after developing seizures and going into cardiac arrest. a later examination of the boy's brain found that he had rabies, the researchers wrote in the report. other tests showed that the dog that bit him also had rabies.\", 'the virus that causes rabies travels along nerve cells until it reaches the brain, where it causes fatal swelling. bites from rabid dogs cause more than 98 percent of the 40 000 to 60 000 cases of rabies among people that occur every year worldwide, the researchers said. tunisia, in northern africa, has one to 2 human rabies deaths a year, typically from people who do not seek treatment after being bitten by dogs.', 'failure of the rabies vaccine is rare. in 1997, researchers reported at a conference that out of 15 million cases in which the vaccine had been used to date, it had failed in just 47 people, said dr. natasha crowcroft, the chief of infectious diseases at public health ontario, who was not involved with the care of the child in the recent case.', 'when the vaccine does fail, it\\'s not unusual for people to have been bitten on the hand or face, parts of the body that have a high concentration of nerves that the rabies virus can potentially infect. moreover, the virus doesn\\'t have to travel far to the brain if it enters through a wound on the face, crowcroft said. usually, \"the rabies virus travels quite slowly to the brain up through the nerves,\" she said. \"when we give the vaccine, it\\'s a race of [the body] making antibodies from the vaccine and the virus traveling up to brain. as soon as the virus gets to the brain, it\\'s too late.\"', 'the boy did not have hydrophobia (fear of water) or excessive salivation, 2 common rabies symptoms, when he returned to the hospital on day 17. \"these features made the diagnosis of rabies encephalitis [swelling of the brain from rabies] difficult, especially in this child, who had received 4 doses of rabies vaccine\" and other treatments, the researchers wrote in the case report.', \"it's possible that the doctors missed a wound that was infected when they examined the child, and, therefore, didn't properly clean and treat it with immunoglobulin, according to the case report. the doctors sutured the bite wound after cleaning and treating it, but if they missed some of the saliva, the suturing may have even helped the virus enter the nerves in the face, the researchers said.\", \"vaccines can also fail if they're expired or not stored at adequate temperatures, but that didn't happen in this case, the researchers said.\", 'there is a pre-exposure rabies vaccine, but its high price makes it difficult to provide to people in developing countries, where many cases of rabies occur. instead, only people who are at high risk of rabies, such as veterinarians, are usually given the pre-exposure vaccine, the researchers said.', 'summary:rabies remains a serious public health problem in many developing countries. the diagnosis is easy when a non-immunised patient presents with hydrophobia and hypersalivation after a bite by a known rabid animal but more difficult when a patient presents atypical symptoms after having received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. rabies post-exposure prophylaxis failure is rare. we report a case of a 6-year-old boy who presented febrile seizure with agitation and cerebellar signs, without hydrophobia or hypersalivation 17 days after a dog bite. despite 4 doses of rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin, he died. diagnostic confirmation of rabies encephalitis was made in post mortem on brain biopsies by the fluorescent antibody technique.', '--communicated by:promed-mail<promed@promedmail.org>', \"[a sad incident. as he had been bitten on his forehead, the virus had not far to travel to reach his

forest during the winter season to seek medical attention if they come down with a fever and headache, as they could have caught scrub typhus or malaria.', 'scrub typhus is spread to people through bites by infected chiggers (larval mites) and the latter [malaria] through bites by female mosquitoes of the genus _anopheles_, said dr opas karnkawinpong, spokesman and deputy permanent secretary for the public health ministry. though the 2 diseases occur year-round, the numbers of cases rise during the winter season.', 'from 1 oct 2017 until 12 jan 2018, there were 2185 scrub typhus patients in thailand, 2 of whom died, said opas.', 'scrub typhus symptoms include fever, headache (especially in the temples and forehead), body aches, and dry cough. symptoms appear 10-12 days after being bitten. some 40 percent of patients also had \"eschars,\" dark red patches of dead skin tissue, around the skin areas where infected chiggers bit them. some patients suffer from serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis, which could turn deadly. chiggers live in shaded humid bushes.', 'opas also advised that people emerging from the forest should shower and wash their clothing right away to prevent chigger bites.', 'scrub typhus is caused by _orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. after feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. the cutaneous reaction to _o. tsutsugamushi_ at the site of the infected chigger bite leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _o. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3034347/).', 'illness in humans develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation

cross-react with rickettsial antigens. the weil-felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/o-619.pdf). the gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (ifa) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for

watering area. it is lamentable that these poachers have not been apprehended and the horrible act stopped.\", 'cyanide can come as either a gas, as in hydrogen cyanide, or as a solid, in the form of

oxygen, because cellular respiration is blocked through the inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase system and inhibition of the enzyme.', 'if cyanide was put out as a crystalline bait, then the perpetrators might have expected crystalline cyanide salts to work faster because of the acid in the stomach. these animals would likely have had difficulty breathing, perhaps causing panic, and then

to investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-[sodium] loss. female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. we found the following consistent with the [sodium]-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, [sodium] in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high [sodium] content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal [sodium]; and 4) elephants in non-kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their [sodium] requirements from ubiquitous [sodium]-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in kalahari-sand habitats.\"', '\"soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (fetio3), hematite (fe2o3), bauxite [alo.oh/al(oh)3], and pyrite (fes2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites, and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides. depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulomb interaction. cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations.\"', \"with bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. it is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in hwange's kalahari sands habitats. however, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. the rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.\", 'while some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. however, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. this would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done.', \"additional information is available from young and jordan's
